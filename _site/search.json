    "text": "The genesis of this project came late night at a restaurant dinner in Charleston. I went out with my family to enjoy one of the delicious seafood locales common to the holy city. Going out with my family is always enjoyable with good conversation and lots of laughs. My parents enjoy taking our family out to eat now because my 4 siblings are mostly college-aged and can behave well in a public setting. However, my youngest brother, Micah, is 7 years old (significantly younger than the rest of my siblings) and isn’t as enticed by the adult conversation. Instead, he enjoys playing with toys or coloring when we go out.\nWhile we were enjoying the boiled peanuts and talking about the menu, Micah was happily trying to solve a word search puzzle on his kids’ menu. He seemed really engaged in finding all the words. He got stuck a few times, and I helped him find a few words, but he remained focused on it for a good portion of the night. Looking back, I know, for Micah, usually the kids’ menu activities don’t get his attention as much as just doodling with crayons does, so thats maybe why the word search puzzle stuck out to me that night. As I was helping him find a few words, I realized I could probably build a simple program to generate a bunch of these for him. He would at least enjoy the first few, right? So, this one’s for Micah.\nI built the web app below. Try it out! Put in a few words and make one for yourself!\n\n\n\n\nThe code I used to generate this puzzle is found here. I will probably write-up a post later detailing the steps I took to program this. Honestly, it was a lot of fun for me.\nIf you enjoyed the post, shoot me a message on social media or share it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "text": "Models last updated November 2, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI created another model for the latest 2024 presidential election here\n\n\nThere are a lot of election models out there - the Economist, FiveThirtyEight, and the Cook Political Report to name a few. So what am I doing here?\n\n\nThe Problem\nHonestly, I was irritated in blindly trusting other’s models. Many election model builders claim to use demographic patterns, previous election results, economic considerations, polls, etc.. But, beside polling numbers, what data exactly are they using and where does it come from? Also, what do their models actually look like? Ideally, I would want enough information to recreate the model myself to see what they actually did, but that information isn’t available. I understand that model-builders may not want to be undermined and critiqued by skeptics where their work may lose credibility to egotistic data lords or others, but even-so I would appreciate more transparency (especially after the 2016 election). Also, I understand that the data that are used may be sensitive information they pay for which is more understandable.\n\n\nWhat I did\nMy goal was to create a model that is based exclusively on recent quality polling, and that’s it! No mysterious variables thrown into already complex models; no sensitive consumer data that feels like violations of privacy; and, no blindly trusting an invisible methodology where you can’t possibly recreate the model. These probabilities are calculated SOLELY from an average of the five latest, quality polls in each state. Here is my methodology and code. Overall, the purpose is to give an educated guess of what would happen if the election were held each week (I plan to update this each day until the election). I mostly did this for an easy way to keep track of the recent polls and pulse check the election map looks at a moments notice.\n\n\n\nI present the Presidential Pulse Checker\nLatest probabilities: (BEST VIEWING ON DESKTOP. If you are on a mobile device, press on states for more info; otherwise, hover.)\n\n\nIf there were 100 presidential elections today in 100 different worlds like ours, how many would Trump/Biden win?\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Tracker: (Percentage of daily simulations won plotted over time; hover for more info)\n\n\nLinks to polling aggregators: FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics.\nThanks for viewing this post.

    "text": "Intro\n(TL;DR I created a weekly COVID email update. Scroll to the bottom to opt-in🙂)\nI’m excited to talk about this latest project🎉🎉\nIn the past few days, Europe has seen a third wave of COVID-19 surge through and several other countries are reporting higher cases this week (~10% increase!). All of this begs the question of whether COVID in the U.S. will have a third strong wave after the what we’ve seen from the delta variant and with winter coming. Here is a tweet from the World Health Organization detailing some of this:\n\n\n\"More than 5 million deaths have now been reported, and we know the real number is higher. We are still losing more than 50,000 of our sisters and brothers every week\"-@DrTedros #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/5jlX3sYNbH\n\n— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) November 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\nSo, Cue In My Project..\nRight when I think I don’t have to worry about COVID anymore, I find myself once again clicking through a website checking case, death, and vaccination rates. Instead of this, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data, so you can be informed with raw data on a weekly check-in basis nationally and for your state.\n\n\nEmail Structure\nAt the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national and your state’s vaccination rates are.\nAttached to the email are two visualizations showing the data trends across time: one showing national trend, the other showing your state’s trend (they look similar to the figure below 👇)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne note: To get the vaccination rate for each state and nationally, I compared the number vaccinated against the TOTAL population (not just 18+ or 12+). I got the state population numbers from the census, and count is included in the figures for reference. I decided to use the total US population because I think that will eventually be relevant as more age groups are approved for various vaccines. If you are interested in different numbers, I have a link with more information included in the weekly email.\nThe code is not viewable for this project because of email privacy, but happy to share code snippets for personal inquiries. Thanks for stopping in.\n\n\nEmbedded Survey Form\nIf you are interested in receiving this brief weekly update, drop your email in below… You can only submit after answering both questions!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe survey is not closed and has been removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

Now, it feels like almost every movie has a sequel and sometimes many more. Lets look at some data to see what’s going on here. For this analysis, I write down a series of questions and answer them one-by-one. Scroll down to see the questions ⬇️\nThis project was fun for me because I worked with a friend who knows a lot more about film than I do. He studied film in school and provided a lot of insight into the post here. From picking interesting questions to ask to interpretting trends and patterns in the data where I was confused, his help was valuable!"

Here are a few interesting links I found specifically about sequels:\n\nI found a kaggle project looking at this question, and I followed a similar data preparation process (without using French Wikipedia). He takes an indepth look at the question.. Are movie sequels less quality?\nThis one gives a good overview of some of the assumptions that go into this type of analysis. For example, “how is a series defined?” and “What do we do with series that have changed significantly over time?”\n\nThis one looks interesting, but several of the figures wouldn’t render on my device which referenced the company silk.co. I am skeptical that this website/company still exists."

Unfortunately, this list was missing a few things I wanted such as the movie’s revenue, budget, language, production company, and other variables. I joined these in via the TMBD API. The data is available for download on the link to the side.\nIn the first chart, I also join in a non-commercial dataset from IMDB which can be accessed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe data from TMDB is community based - meaning people self-report the revenue and some of the other data. Unfortunately, this means that there may be errors at times in the data. There are state-of-the-art data and APIs available, but only through paywalls and I’m not paying 😂"

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\n\nAre There More Sequels Over Time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUpon manual inspection of the data, I noticed that the list did not include a lot of movie sequels after 2010 eventhough some exist. For example, my data includes the first 5 Tinker Bell Movies up until 2012, but does not include movies 6-8. Yes, there are 8 Tinker Bell movies😂. So, I would interpret the decrease in sequels after 2012 with caution.\n\n\n\nMain Takeaway: It seems there was a spike in sequels after the year 2000. And, the spike in sequels may have come a little bit before the spike in movies, but, generally, sequel production has followed the movie production trend overall and increased over time.\n\n\nDo Sequels Make More Than The Original?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI noticed that several movie revenues were missing, so I went through each missing value and looked up the revenue here which is the recommended resource for TMDB contributors (read more in the TMDB Bible). Originally, there were some significant movies that showed $0 such as Avatar (the blue people version), one of the best performing films ever. I added in all the latest numbers in the data that can be downloaded on the right.\nThese number are inflation adjusted using the CPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart is interactive. Click or press the different points which each represent a different series. Use the toolbar to zoom in and out on certain parts of this graph for further exploration.\nNotice how more dots are below the line then above the line, this indicates that the originals typically perform better than the sequels. But, lets look at a few other charts to confirm our thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may be surprised to see Bambi as the highest original film box office in my sequel dataset. But, remember, this film was first released in 1942 with a worldwide box office of $268 Million. In today’s dollars, this is valued a lot higher!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAbove, I define “About the same” when the revenue of the sequel is the same as the original within a 10% margin (+/- 5%)\n\n\nLooking at a simple crosstab breakout above, we see that the original movie is likely to make more money than the sequel more than 60% of the time.\n\nHowever, if you look at the distributions between the original and the sequel, they look quite similar. There is an exception though: sequels are much more likely to make zero dollars.\nMain Takeaway: More than 60% of the time, the original outperforms the sequel. If the sequel makes revenue, the sequel may perform similarly to the original in revenue.\n\n\nAre Sequels Rated Higher Than The Original?\n\nThe IMDB distributions for these are fairly gaussian bell-curve looking. As you can see, the Original is on average rated higher with a median rating of 6.9 whereas the sequel is on averate rated lower with a median of 6.1.\nWe are just looking at the overall distributions here, but we can calculate the actual average difference in score which I do below.\n\ndef imdb_diff(data_part):\n  tmp = data_part.sort_values(\"sequel_num\").reset_index(drop=True)\n  return tmp.loc[0,\"IMDb Rating\"] - tmp.loc[1,\"IMDb Rating\"]\n\ndiff = data.query(\"sequel_num in [1,2]\") \\\n  .groupby(\"sequel_group\") \\\n  .apply(imdb_diff) \\\n  .mean()\n\ndiff = round(diff,2)\n\nprint(f\"On average, the original is rated {diff} points higher than its sequel\")\n\nOn average, the original is rated 0.77 points higher than its sequel\n\n\n\n\nAre Sequels More Popular Than The Original?\n\nThe TMDB popularity score is intended to be a “lifetime popularity score” for movies. It is created by putting together website traffic and human interaction with each movie on TMDB. You can read a more indepth discussion of this metric here.\nTakeaway: According to TMDB’s popularity metric, originals and sequels look similar in popularity with the originals perhaps having a slight edge.\nI was supprised when this variable was shockingly right skewed. I assumed the creators would have normalized their score, so that is why I log transform here.\n\n\nDo Sequels Typically Recieve Less Budget?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese number are inflation adjusted using the CPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor most the analysis, I use just the original and first sequel; however, for this chart and the next, we look include more sequels.\n\n\nTakeaway: Lower numbers of sequels are more common (you can see the N-size decrease as the sequel number increases), but the trend is clear; sequels on average recieve a higher budget.\n\n\nWhich Production Companies Make The Most Sequels?\n\nTakeaway: Of the companies listed, each one dips its fingers in the sequel game. But, according to our data, 20th Century Fox and Universal Studios have made the most sequels.\nFuture note: It would be interesting to see the total number of movies each company has made to compare the proportion.\n\n\nWhat Predicts The Monetary Success of Sequels?\nFor this section, I created a statistical model to help answer the next few questions. The model is good measuring the independent impact of multiple variables inputted. This method will help us tease out more findings from out data.\nIt is important to keep in mind that this model is predicting the difference in revenue from original to sequel and the factors that influence this difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can view my modeling steps and process in my downloadable python script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact\nSignificant\n\n\n\n\nsame_director\n-\nFalse\n\n\ntime_between\n-\nTrue\n\n\nimdb_diff\n+\nTrue\n\n\naction\n+\nTrue\n\n\nhorror\n+\nFalse\n\n\ncomedy\n+\nFalse\n\n\nromance\n-\nFalse\n\n\nfamily\n-\nFalse\n\n\nbudget_diff\n+\nFalse\n\n\nwarner_bros\n-\nFalse\n\n\nfox\n-\nFalse\n\n\ndisney\n-\nFalse\n\n\nuniversal\n+\nFalse\n\n\nmarvel\n+\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a table showing us the impact of each variable (Impact) positive or negative and whether the model was able to statistically differentiate the effect from zero (Significant).\nI will note a few things here, but a few of the findings in this table relate to future questions. So will leave those parts for those sections.\nTakeaway #1: Having a higher quality movie (higher IMDB score) has a positive significant effect on the revenue of the sequel.\nTakeaway #2: Some genres could perform better than others. We see a positive effect from sequels of action (Maybe that’s why there are so many super hero movies 🤷‍♂️). While these relationship are not statistically significant, our model’s best guess for horror and action sequels is a positive effect and for family and romance sequels is a negative effect. Perhaps with more sequel data we could detect differences there.\nTakeaway #3: None of the big production companies have a positive statistically significant impact on the revenue of a sequel when compared to the original.\n\n\nHow Does Timing Affect A Sequel’s Success?\n\nTakeaway: The answer? It’s not good. In fact, our model predicts that for each additional year of waiting, the sequel will lose $50 Million on average.\n\n\nDo Sequels With More Budget Fair Better?\n\nTakeaway: As you can see, the line is pretty flat meaning budget does not have a meaningful impact in our model. Though our model’s best guess is budget having a positive impact on sequel revenue.\n\n\nAre Sequels Who Keep The Same Director More Or Less Successful?\n\nTakeaway: Our model doesn’t find a statistically significant relationship between keeping directors. Interestingly, our model’s best guess is a negative impact on sequel revenue when a director is kept."

However, my dataset contains a lot more than that! It would be interesting continuing this analysis looking at how adding more sequels after the first affects things like popularity, IMDB score, and revenue.\nI mainly focused on revenue as my primary dependent variable. Perhaps exploring IMDB score and popularity would also be interesting dependent variables.\nWhen I was finishing up the analysis I found that TMDB has a part of its API where you can access collections which are functionally movie series. For researchers interested in a more exansive dataset than I compiled, this may be a good place to start.\nIt would be interesting to zoom in on a particular subset. For example, maybe a specific production company has meaningful differences to explore or a specific genre."

    "text": "A look into US car sales data in the last 25 years…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis project started out as me trying to recreate a moving bar chart. I saw them around online and thought they were a cool way to visualize data over time that reminded me of a “data race.” Ironically, I came across a great site that stores car sales data over time, and thought it was the perfect fit to create a “race chart.” However, after I created my moving bar chart, I was still interested in learning more about car trends over time, and thought you might be as well. So, I decided to make some figures and write up a short piece.\nIn this post, I want to answer these two bullet-points:\n\nWhat have US car brand sales looked like since 1996?\nWhat is the top car brand now and since 1996 in the United States? What brands have sold more over time?\n\nNote: There is a reason I’m using 1996 as my starting point. The data I scraped is partially incomplete. There aren’t missing observations after the first data point, but some starting points are much later than when the brand begins selling cars. For example, the first recorded number of sales for Chevrolet in the dataset was in 1996 despite it being founded in 1911. The other brands seemed to begin and end at reasonable times according to my knowledge, and all brands seemed to have full data after 1996. Because of this, I decided to use 1996 as a starting point for the following figures. Even though it feels somewhat arbitrary, 23 years is still a sizable chunk of time to view car sales.\n\n\n\nWhat have car brand sales looked like in the past 23 years?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a few notable trends since 1996. Firstly, the United States experienced an economic recession around 2008–09 which clearly affected car sales. Almost every brand dropped in sales at that time and some of the big brands never fully recovered even in 2019 - almost a decade later. With an initial look, it might appear that the car industry has sold fewer units over time. But, if you look at the aggregated yearly car sales (below), you can see that people are buying just as many cars in 2019 as they were before the recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what does this mean? This means that more of the market share of car sales is distributed among more brands today than in the past. Hopefully, this is positive news as it may suggest that the market is more competitive with more companies having more power in the car sales market.\nOne could argue that we are actually selling less cars because there are more people in America in 2019 as compared to 1996, and so the car sales per capita is lower. The figure above does not control for confounding variables like this, but only looks at the raw car sales number over time. I mention this because when viewing any figure it is always important to keep possible confounding variables in mind. However, in this case, I still think that car sales data has an interesting story to tell and can be particularly valuable in making relative comparisons. With these relative comparisons (comparing Ford to Toyota etc.), the population confounding variable is controlled for as the US population differences between ’96 and 2019 shift the same amount for both US brands. Using a comparison, you just see one brand simply out-performing another because it holds time variables, like change in overall US population, constant.\n\n\n\nWhat is the top car brand now and over the last 20 years in the United States? What brands have sold more over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from the race graph in the beginning, Ford has consistently sold more units than any other brand in the past 25 years. This figure shows the total sales of each of the brands from 1996-2019 with Ford in the lead. While it is easy to see who sold the most cars with a graph like this over a period of time, you cannot see how the individual businesses trended over that time period. Perhaps one brand steadily grew, while another sold a lot of cars at first, but then went bankrupt. So, we still don’t know which brands have truly grown and done better over time. To help answer this question, I created two more figures. The first shows a brand’s increase or decrease in market share, and the second shows a relative comparison of sales growth over the time period. Both figures show a different aspect of brand growth.\nTechnical note: This figure does not control for whether the total number of car sales is increasing or decreasing. Normally, it might be wise to put these on a scale showing the percent of the market share they each took, but since the total market share is relatively close to the same over time (as seen in figure 3), and the market in general has been quite dynamic, I believe you can see the trends by just subtracting the first and last year.\nIn the figure above, we can see at the top of the list: Nissan, Toyota, and Honda. All of these brands now take significantly more of the market share in 2019 as compared to 1996. This means that their business has increased over time and has made positive absolute change. But, we may also want to know which companies have actually grown significantly in size. This would give us a better picture of which companies have really taken off. (If you think about it, a huge monopoly can increase in sales 1% which increase might mean a higher number of sales than everyone else because that 1% means a lot of cars, but the huge monopoly isn’t really experiencing growth.) The figure below specifically shows which companies relatively have increased in size since 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\nKia, Nissan, and Tesla are the top three brands that have seen the highest percentage increases from 1996 to 2019. While percentage change can be helpful, it can often be misleading. For example, if a person A sells 1 car the first year and then 10 cars the next year they are performing at 1000% compared to their previous year while person B sold 1 million cars the first year and will have to sell significantly more than 10 cars to get their percentages to match person A. Person B might be dominating the market, but if you only looked at percentage increases you may never know.\nThese two figures become particularly useful if brands appear on the top of both (which some do!). For those brands, it means that they are both selling a significantly higher portion of the market share and have significantly increased in size compared with the starting year which, in this case, points to Nissan, Hyundai, and Subaru.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAs we have looked through the data, we have found a few insights about the car sales market since 1996:\n\nFord has consistently sold more cars any other brand since 1996 and remains in the lead in 2019.\nThe US recession in 2008-09 had a large impact on the car sales market decreasing yearly car sales as much as 7 million overall, but has recovered since that time.\nPartially because of the recession, today, more brands have more of the market share than in 1996.\nA few brands have seen substantial growth during the last 23 years and now hold a significant portion of the market share. These brands include Nissan, Subaru, and Hyundai.\n\nMy coding is viewable here. I modeled my race chart off of this post.\nThank you for looking through this post, and I hope you enjoyed it. Feel free to comment below, and I encourage you to share with others if you found it interesting. For my next project, I want to look at car companies over time and how they relate to car brands… so stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "Mobility in the COVID-19 Era: Urban vs. Rural",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn this unprecedented time, America and the world have experienced drastic changes in many aspects of modern day life. In an effort to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus, American leaders urged for precautionary measures such as closing non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and general social distancing protocol across the country.\nThe coronavirus has plagued our nation for several months now. In this post, I aim to answer two questions:\n\nHow did mobility of Americans change over time?\nDid urban and rural mobility trends differ?\n\nTo answer these questions, I needed to find relevant, trusted data sources. Luckily, @NateSilver538 tweeted a link and a few frequencies of this mobility from data posted by Apple’s Apple Maps. Apple claims that “reports are published daily and reflect requests in Apple Maps.” This source is great because because it shows mobility trends before and during COVID-19 taking hold in America; however, there are a few obvious limitations. First, many people do not use mapping services for local destinations, so people could still being going places, but simply do not use the mapping service to indicate where they go. This will still be effective for tourism and tech-reliant individuals. Secondly, many people do not use the apple mapping service, preferring Google or other services for their travel. While noting these limitations, I still think there are enough people using Apple Maps and putting directions into their phone to generally track mobility trends in state and counties over time.\nAs I thought about appropriate ways to measure how urban or rural a county was, I realized the complexity of the problem. Many counties are perhaps mostly urban and mostly rural, but still many exist that are difficult to label as one or the other. After a little research, I came across a very helpful resource put together by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). In 2013, they created their most recent classification system that divided counties into 6 groups based on their urbanization level. This would be a perfect resource for my purposes.\n\n\n\nHow Did Mobility of Americans Change Over Time?\nFor this first question, I created a figure to show the data. I looked at general mobility trends for each state from mid-January til the end of May. When I first plotted this data, I was surprised by all of the noise on the graph. It looked more or less like a cartogram measuring many heartbeats. I realized that Americans are more likely to enter navigations on certain days of the week, for weekends are more popular for traveling than Mondays and Tuesdays. So, for this reason, I decided to show the weekly mean of mobility to show clearer general trends. Additionally, each state starts at its own average mobility (set arbitrarily at 100) and any increase or decrease from that point is a percentage increase or decrease from that state’s average.\n(Technical note: all of the points on the graph do not start at 100 because the baseline is the sum of navigation requests for each area on January 23rd. Whereas, each point represents the weekly mean. So, lines with points starting higher than 100 on average had higher mobility requests after the first day.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows a slight increase near the end of February into March followed by a drastic decrease as shutdown for COVID-19 starts. It is clear that from mid-march to mid-April mobility trends in the US dipped drastically, but now many states’ mobility are returning back to normal.\nNote the overall variance of US states during February compared to the overall variance of US states at the end of May. There is much greater spread in the data at the end of May. This may signify that each state is in a different place in their recovery from COVID-19. Some states are lagging behind in their mobility while a few states even show significantly higher mobility rates even greater than pre-corona times; however, it seems the bulk of states have returned to almost-normal to normal mobility trends as of May 31st. Perhaps this is the case because more people like to travel in pleasant summer weather, or are ready to get out of the house after being cooped up.\n\n\n\nDid urban and rural mobility trends differ over time?\nTo answer this question, I created two figures: one to show different states and counties returning to normal, and the other to look specifically at urban, suburban, and rural counties. The map below shows an interactive heat map across time. This is great at showing mobility trends across various states (and counties). It also shows the drastic decrease in mobility beginning mid-March, and the return to normal.\n(Best viewing on Desktop; Press the play button for 😎)\n\n\nThe “white” color signifies average mobility while red shows higher mobility, and blue shows lower. Viewing the map over time, it seems to show states and counties with higher population dipping lower in mobility during the largest period of the COVID-19 shutdown, and also lagging behind others in returning to normal mobility at the end of May. While we may have a general idea which counties are truly urban, suburban, and rural, it can be hard to tell from the map.\nFor the last figure, I thought it would be more appropriate to look at county-level data as it is a smaller grouping geographically that can be more clearly defined as either urban, suburban, or rural. I incorporated the data from the NCHS to code various counties according to their individual level of urbanization, and then, I grouped the counties by rural, suburban, and urban.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these trends over time, it is what you might expect: rural counties maintain higher relative mobility across time. The gap between rural and urban widens toward the end of May with urban counties falling behind. Interestingly, many urban-classified areas seem to have returned to normal - though I expect urban counties in large cities like NYC to help in pulling down the urban average. The rural and suburban counties end well above their average in January which perhaps might suggest a trend where many people may want to move and travel after being living at home for a while.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile confounding variables exist such as some states have stay at home orders and other do not, this data shows a fairly good display of mobility trends overtime. Here is what we found from our analysis:\n\nMobility of Americans significantly decreased in March through April, but is beginning to return to normal for many states.\nEach state is returning to normal at its own rate with some states recovering much faster than others.\nRural and suburban counties have maintained higher mobility trends compared to urban counties with increasing disparity over time.\nMany states and counties have higher mobility ratings than pre-corona times which might be suggestive of a large wave of movement after Americans were kept inside with stay at home orders; however, it is important to note that mobility trends are general higher in the summer time anyway.\n\nMy coding is viewable here.\nThank you for looking through this post, and I hope you enjoyed it. I encourage you to share with others if you found it interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "My Facebook Data… EXPOSED",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Do you like the title? You can thank all of my click-bait ad consumption for that.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs some of you may know, my work is fairly political, so I have developed a habit of staying up to date on news and politics. Recently, social media has made some headlines including talks at congressional hearings, reporters expressing concern over its influence on elections, and some are worrying about censorship. So, amid all of this (and the rest of this post is a much lighter tone than this intro), I wanted to download my personal data from Facebook to show an overview of the role its played in my life since I got an account.\n\n👇Read This👇\nI made 4 figures from MY Facebook data. In my next project, I’m making a web app that lets YOU upload YOUR data and will generate these same figures for YOU. So, be thinking about what these figures would look like for YOUR data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWhew Ok. Lets see what’s going on here. Most clearly, my reactions spiked in 2020. My posts also inched up during that time. Wow, I guess the pandemic has increased my social media usage😬, but starting this blog last year probably contributed to this. Another thing, if you look closer, notice that there are no data points for 2015. In 2015, I was on my church service mission for the entire year and didn’t use social media! But, my friends spiked in 2016 accounting for the friends I made during that time and college freshman friends. Also, I moved twice in my 2019 college year and met a lot of people which explains the second friend bump. Hmm I wonder what YOUR graph would look like?👀👀\nNote: I aggregated the data by year. So, my 2021 data points are lower than the rest, but this may not be because I have used Facebook less during 2021, but rather there are many days left in this year that haven’t been accounted for.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWell the “Love” emoji is my most popular from the last year. When I made this graph originally using ALL of my data, I just got a bunch of “Like”s because that was the only reaction available for a long time; hence, I decided to filter the data to the last year only. Hmm perhaps I should try using the care/angry emojis.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Best Facebook Friends Wordlcloud\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, this is what we’re really here for. The bigger the name, the better friends my method thinks I am to that person. So for me, Austin Sebaske-Smith and Brandon Archer are my best FB friends, and turns out they are both worthy of that title🥺. If your name isn’t big or on the chart don’t worry, I still care about you too.\nHow I did this: I gave a certain amount of “friendship points” for each time you reacted to a person, mentioned a person in a comment, posted about a person, etc. Afterwards, I totaled these points for each friend. I then weighted by interaction(if I mentioned you in a post or comment, It could mean more than a simple reaction to a post) and recency.\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last chart was a fun add-on for me. Using a simple model, I processed all of my comments and posts and tried to determine which were positive and negative. Thankfully, a lot of my interactions were coded as positive😁. Though I think this is largely due to commenting for friend’s birthdays.\nHow I did this: there is a whole subsection of data science that is particularly focused on a computer understanding different sentiments in written text. It is called Natural Language Processing. This is fairly new field that has A LOT of room to grow. So there can be low accuracy and many errors. I used a dictionary that has words coded as positive and negative and I matched it my comments and posts for these scores.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\nNow my secrets are exposed - Oh well. Thanks for reading:) Shoot me a message or something if you would be interested in the app that generates these graphs for YOU. It might help me have more motivation to finish it.\nMy code for this post is here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "section": "",
    "text": "In April 2020, I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in Political Science. I now work as a data scientist at Dynata. Here are a few notes in hopes of helping my social science friends who want to break into data science.\n\nBeginnings\nAt my university, all political science students were required to take an intensive stats course. We learned the fundamentals of statistics applied to social science problems like income inequality, racism, and elections. I was fascinated learning about statistical techniques that could make predictions or show whether a variable had a statistically significant effect. I realized so many interesting questions could be aided with the help of data and statistics. This course was actually the most I had enjoyed a class up to this point. After this course, I wanted to pursue opportunities using the skills I had learned, so I researched and found an internship with TargetPoint Consulting. Fortunately, my university had a database of internships that previous students had done with filters for your interests. I reached out via email, I soon had an interview lined up, and the internship was mine!\nWhile I didn’t do any data science work, (I mostly made slides and and QA-ed surveys before launch) this provided invaluable experience and led to landing my first job. They allowed me to do a small passion project where I analyzed the political affiliations of different sports fans (baseball vs. football vs. basketball) and made a visual about it. Here comes the first tip…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInternships are an invaluable way to get your foot in the door to a field and help you land entry-level jobs\n\n\nAfter my internship finished, I had about a year left in my undergrad, so I tried to take more political science statistics classes. I took data visualization with R, advanced statistical analysis, and qualitative methods.\n\n\nMy First Job\nAs my undergrad was finishing up, I sent out applications to so many places! I heard back from mostly market research firms because my internship was in market research. Echelon Insights reached out to me for an interview as a Research Analyst. In the interview, one of their main question was asking about my small passion project about sports fans political affiliation. Needless to say, I was hired. My boss at Echelon Insights was familiar with the work and people from TargetPoint (my intership), which no doubt helped me secure a spot at my first job post undergrad.\nI spent about 2 years at Echelon Insights and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I felt a lot of the work we were doing was very interesting (a lot of political work) and my bosses and coworkers were very kind and intelligent. At first, a lot of my work was dealing with deliverable creation (slide decks and topline creation). I expressed interest in more data-oriented tasks which included loading a survey into R and joining some data, weighting a survey, finding and joining county-level data. They eventually put me on projects where I was able to work on modeling. For example, I helped with a project where we modelled phone response rates. Also, I worked on a model predicting voter turnout in a specified region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, it is easier to transition tasks and roles in a company to be a data scientist than it is to get random data science jobs on LinkedIn. As you take on more data science tasks, you can put it on a resume to land another data science job elsewhere.\nBonus: In most office jobs, there are things that can be automated or ways to use coding. Taking initiative and trying to automate can be experience you put on a resume and can help you transition roles\n\n\nIf I were to give advice to an aspiring data scientist in social sciences, I would say that market research is a great place to get started. There are more project manager/researcher type jobs that are easier for SS folks to break into and from there, they can transition to data science. Most market research firms I am aware of have a data science arm.\n\n\nThe Rest\nWhile I really enjoyed my time at Echelon Insights, I was spending more time doing project management tasks than data science tasks and I wanted to change that. So, I decided to leave for a job with a larger company where I could solely focus on data science tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is easier to transition roles at a smaller company (gradually take on more tasks) than a larger one where roles are more segmented and defined. My time at Echelon Insights was perfect for this (around 10 employees at the time)\n\n\nI joined the data science team at Morning Consult, another market research firm, as a Senior Data Analyst and gained a lot of valuable experience. They had a large number of data scientists with much more mature codebases. I used R for the majority of my days at Morning Consult and got to contribute to some cool coding projects including building a python web bot that automated test survey creation. There still was some hold-ups as the data science team was quite bloated and most of my time was spent creating neat data tables for clients instead of modeling and doing the data science tasks I was interested in. A lot of the data science specific tasks were already taken by other people (60ish data analysts and scientists). Also, at the time, the data science team programmed surveys in qualtrics which ate up far too much of my time than I desired.\nFrom this point, I applied for other positions where I got to practice more statistics and eventually accepted a data scientist position at my current company, Dynata. I have been really pleased with my position and have gotten to work on fun data science projects such as building an attribute drivers, difference-in-difference, and multi-touch attribution codebase and products associated with them. I also perform advanced analytical studies using these codebases.\n\n\nAside On Leveling Up Your Skillset\nThroughout this process, I needed to level up some of my technical skills. For example, in the political science department, they didn’t teach me anything about python(though i did learn some R) and fundamentals of coding/programming. Also, while I learned a decent amount about economentrics, there is a lot more out there that I needed to discover about machine learning methods and techniques.\nTo level up my coding ability, I bought a python course on Udemy. I worked through this course throughout my first job at Echelon Insights. I also bought a year subscription to Datacamp. While datacamp is helpful learning different packages in python and R, I learned more from the python course on Udemy.\nTo level up my technical data science knowledge, I applied and graduated with my Master’s in Data Science from the University of Virginia. The program was part-time online over the course of two years. I also started this program midway through my first job and then graduated this past May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are many free or cheap resources online that can you can utilize to learn coding and data science. Use these online courses as an edge to be better at coding. Ideally, I try to have a course or something I can work through about a different data science skill at any given time. I may not finish all these courses and I definitely take healthy breaks from them.\n\n\nI also would recomment having a place to put the stuff you learn as you work through courses. Make a portfolio or a blog site (like this one) to show off!\n\n\nConclusion\nEvery career path is different and I’m sure there are dozens more ways social science graduates can break into data science, but here is my path. I sincerely hope that its valuable to you!\nI am very happy to chat if you would like to talk more about any aspect of this or want more details. Also, I’ll respond if you comment below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI wrote a companion piece here called ‘Do I need a Master’s for Data Science?’ if you enjoyed reading this one 🙂\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "Myth of Latter-day Saint Prosperity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs a member of the LDS church, I have grown up hearing the claim although US Latter-day Saints make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the US general population. I assume this is a common misconception, given the amount of times I have heard it, as well as something I believed myself. At some point, I came across an article regarding Mormons in the US. I would just refer you to that article and you could be on your way, but the data is from 2009 - which is almost 15 years ago now! What a perfect opportunity for me to bake up some yummy data snacks regarding the breakdown of Latter-day Saints by household income and how it has changed over time.\n\n\nThe Snacks\nUsing data from a large political survey project of 500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021, I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6,452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a previous blog post I wrote up here if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this household income figure, we can answer our our first question! In 2021, the LDS actually has larger lower and middle classes and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth.\nI included Jews for the sake of including a group that actually is proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket than Latter-day Saints.\nNow lets look at how this trend has changed over the last 15 years…\nOur data source we used above is only for 2019-21, so we need to combine another source for this next graph. Pew Research Center publishes a religous landscape study that collects large sample sizes of most religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From this, we can look at 3 snapshots of LDS income over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt definitely looks like income is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. However, this doesn’t account for forces like inflation and how the overall US population has moved over the last 15 years. So let’s make another one, to see how income has changed compared to the general population\nSide note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracket has remained relatively stable over time. While we don’t have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle income bracket shrinks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking now at the Latter - day Saint group over time, the percentage of households making 100k+ consistently remains lower than the overall population. Also, it seems that the gap between the overall population and Latter - day Saints is growing over time. In 2007, there is a 6 point difference and goes from 6 to 8 to finally 11. Perhaps not only are Latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!\nLatter-day Saints are not a poor group overall (30% make 6-figures+!), this information just disputes the claim that Latter-Day Saints are proportionally wealthy.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe code that I used to analyze this data and create the graphs above are found on github. Please reach out with any questions or thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

The more I look into searches, the more I’m impressed by the interesting and vast amount of data avaiable.\nFor example, i recently learned that Google Trends is quite effective in predicting large elections here and here. I even went through the exercise of looking myself at the last 5 US elections. Excluding the 2020 election, the winning candidate had more search volume months leading up to the elections. The trend did not hold for Trump’s last election, but maybe we chalk that up to Trump being a peculiar candidate or 2020 being a peculiar year."

    "text": "Honing in on the GOP Primary Nomination\nMy thought was that if Google Trends can be effective for US Presidential Elections, what about Primaries? Instead of diving into the past, I thought I would make one tracking the race right now, and worry about that other stuff later.\nTo visualize the race, I wanted to make a stream chart for two reasons:\n\nYou can see the relative importance each candidate has to one another given by vertical distance of each color at a given point in time.\nYou also get a sense of the total search volume of all candidates given by the vertical distance of all colors at a given point in time. I plan to keep this chart updated up until the primary election. I guess we’ll see how accurate it is in the end 🤷‍♂️.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis graph is updated on a daily basis to provide continuous context to the GOP Primary Election.

For example, we can see different candidates spiking at different times. Nikki Haley spikes in mid-February then dies down after she announces her run. Trump spiked in April from trial stuff. Vivek Ramaswamy spiked after the first debate as did Trump, and Ron DeSantis seems to be gradually declining since May.\n\n\nObservation 2\nOverall, it seems like Trump is taking the lionshare of hits with the others following behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI expect the graph to look more and more like a funnel as the primary nomination approaches and more people search these candidates, but we’ll see 👀\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Aggregated Google Trends data of popular GOP Primary candidates in the last 10 days of available Google Search data.

Trump is leading at 56% of the hits (polling aggregator says 55%) with the others following behind. More people are searching Ramaswamy and Haley than DeSantis contrary to the polling aggregator which could indicate any number of things including DeSantis is losing popularity. I expect this to change quickly with the pattern of the news cycle."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nFor my friends who use Quarto, perhaps you need to update a particular blog post daily, weekly, or at some other time interval. You could redeploy your site manually every day, but this would be tedious and inefficient. Another option is to use GitHub actions to help you with this task. For high computational tasks using GitHub Actions can cost money, but rendering a small website and running a small script everything is free!\nFor those curious, this problem has surfaced with two of my previous posts: my election model and the google trends primary tracker. For my election model, I used the tedious, inefficient approach back in 2020 (manually running and updating a repository), but for the primary tracker, I have implemented an automated approach. Hopefully someone can benefit from this post!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not a post detailing every possible approach to using GitHub Actions and Quarto. This is just my implementation given my stack.\n\n\n\n\nMy Stack for My Quarto Site\nI build a static site with Quarto, then I keep this site in a repository on GitHub. I have connected this repository to Netlify which redeploys my site when new changes are pushed to the repository.\n\n\nInsert Code that Rerenders in Quarto Document\nFor this particular project, I wanted to have a daily update of the Google Trends search scores of GOP candidates. So, in my quarto document, i have an Rscript that uses the gtrendsr package to pull the latest data every time the document is rendered. So, to complete our task, we just need the remote environment to simply rerender the site and push to the repository. Here is a snippet of an Rscript in a code chunk inside the quarto document which grabs the data and creates a figure:\n\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggstream)\nlibrary(showtext)\nfont_add_google(\"Cairo\", family = \"Cairo\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\nobj &lt;- gtrends(\n    keyword = c(\"Donald Trump\", \"Ron DeSantis\", \"Mike Pence\", \"Nikki Haley\", \"Vivek Ramaswamy\"),\n    time = paste(\"2023-01-01\",as.character(Sys.Date())),\n    geo = \"US\",\n    onlyInterest = TRUE\n)\n\ndf &lt;- obj$interest_over_time\n\ndf$hits &lt;- as.numeric(ifelse(df$hits == \"&lt;1\", \"0.5\", df$hits))\n\ncols &lt;- c(\"cadetblue3\", \"cornsilk3\", \"coral\", \"lightgoldenrod2\", \"palegreen3\")\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = hits, fill = keyword)) +\n    geom_stream(type = \"mirror\") + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = cols) + \n    ggtitle(\"Search Popularity Since January 2023\") +\n    xlab(\"Year 2023\") +\n    ylab(\"Google Search Hits\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 2, size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n        panel.background = element_blank(),\n        text = element_text(face = \"bold\", family = \"Cairo\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = \"bold\"),\n        legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, family = \"Cairo\"),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 2.55, size = 10, face = \"italic\")\n    ) + \n    scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%b\",date_breaks = \"1 month\") + \n    guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Keyword\"))\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions Portion\nYou’ll notice when you navigate to a github repository, there is a tab entitled Actions. After clicking on this tab, you should see some files that you can choose as starters. I don’t recall which template I used. I believe they had one for R which was the one that I used.\nI will paste my .yml file I used for my configuration. Feel free to copy, paste, and edit to your liking.\n\nname: 'Update Stream Graphs'\n\non:\nschedule:\n    - cron: \"0 12 * * *\"\njobs:\nquarto-rerender:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.SECRETS }}\n    - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n        version: \"1.3.433\"\n    - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n        r-version: '4.2.0'\n    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n        with:\n        packages:\n            any::readr\n            any::ggplot2\n            any::ggstream\n            any::rmarkdown\n            any::showtext\n            any::knitr\n            any::gtrendsR\n    - name: clone personal site\n        run: |\n        git config --global user.name \"github actions\"\n        git config --global user.email \"acbass49@gmail.com\"\n        git clone \"https://github.com/acbass49/personal_quarto_site.git\"\n        shell: bash\n    - name: re-render site\n        run: |\n        cd personal_quarto_site\n        quarto render\n        shell: bash\n    - name: push new version\n        run: |\n        cd personal_quarto_site\n        git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.SECRETS }}@github.com/acbass49/personal_quarto_site.git\n        git add .\n        git commit -m \"StreamGraph Update\"\n        git push\n        shell: bash\n\nThis file is found in my website repository.\nA few callouts and things I tweeked along the way…\n\nI had a difficult time finding a resource that let me push remotely to a github repository, but this seemed to do the trick git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.SECRETS }}@github.com/acbass49/personal_quarto_site.git. The ${{ secrets.SECRETS }} portion is an environment variable that is a github Personal Access Token. You will have to create a personal access token and insert this into a repository environment variable.\nMany continuous deployment files run on Ubuntu, but I was having issues getting my figures to be correctly sized as I originally created the figures on a mac, so I used macos-latest instead which solved this problem.\nFor a time, I was having issues with the deployed version being significantly different from my local version. To solve this problem, I made sure to use the version argument with Quarto and matched it to my local version. So make sure to match those if possible!\nIf you are unfamiliar with cron timing, there are several calculators online. My cron time is set to run every morning (I think around 6am EST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am by no means an expert at this (feel free to suggest even further efficiencies to what I already have), but I hope that this will benefit someone who was in a similar position as me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "Do I Need A Master’s Degree For Data Science?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nAfter writing this article, it was shortly after published on the UVA data science blog here.\n\n\nIn March of 2021, after researching for quite some time, I decided to do a Master’s in Data Science. A little over two years later, I recieved my MS in Data Science from the University of Virginia. I hope to provide readers with some insight into benefits (and drawbacks) of pursuing a Master’s Degree in the data science field.\nI’ll break up my thoughts into three main sections:\n\nMy experience and tips in deciding to do a Master’s Degree\n\nMy experience and tips in choosing a program\n\nOther reflections and notes\n\n\nMy experience deciding to go back to school\nThis path is unique to every person, of course. it’s worth noting that talk is most data scientists have at least a master’s degree, but it is not necessarily required. This is at least according to a few links I found googling around; but also matches my personal experience as all of my data scientist collegues at my current workplace have a master’s or a PHD. Regardless, I’ll walk you through my logic in making my own decision.\nMoney : This bit depends on the program you choose, but still will generally require a monetary sacrifice (at least of my US friends.) I was fortunate enough to attend a low cost private institution (about $5k a year in tuition) for my undergrad. Working through school and with help from my parents, I graduated without debt. Because I didn’t have debt, I was more willing to spend money on a Master’s degree a year after my undergrad. This however won’t be the case with everyone, especially if you aren’t interested in more debt or want more of a break from school.\nTime Commitment : This also depends on the program you choose. Because I knew that I wouldn’t recieve financial help from my parents for my Master’s Degree, I wanted the option to work full-time while attending school part-time to offset the cost. This was a trade-off as I had to sacrifice many nights and weekends over a two year period. With that being said, I also graduated without any debt because I was able to work full-time through it. Regardless of your program and how flexible it is, getting a master’s degree is a time commitment. You need to take set aside X time to take Y credits no matter how long you spread it out.\nField Value : How valuable will this be for my career if completed? I think this depends on each individual situation. For example, someone with an undergrad STEM degree may have an easier time breaking into data science than someone with a social science degree. Therefore, a master’s degree in data science would be more valuable for the person with a degree in a social science field than with a degree in a STEM field.\nHowever, if you are already working as a data scientist, it probably doesn’t matter what degree you had in your undergrad at this point because experience generally is seen as more valuable than education when getting jobs.\nEducational Value : I believe the act of learning is instrisically valuable, and I think degrees help you learn. Certainly you don’t need a degree to learn about a subject, but if you are a person that benefits from professors with answers and a structured curriculum, I think the learning opportunity from a degree is instrisically valuable. If you are not that person, there are so many online courses and online resources for learning everything about data science. It is a field that can be learned in self-study. For me, I wanted more exposure to the field of data science in a structured, comprehensive curriculum, which I recieved!\nDecision: At the time, I decided to go forward with a masters because I had the time, the means, and a gap in my knowledge. I also beleived that this degree would help my professional career which it did. From the start to the end of the program, I went from data analyst to data scientist and my salary doubled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA master’s degree in Data Science is especially valuable to those who have never worked in data science before and do not have a STEM degree in undergrad. I found myself in this position which made a master’s degree very valuable for me in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\nMy experience choosing a program\nI looked into and researched several different programs. Here are some of the things I looked for:\nFocus : As you start looking into this, you’ll notice that there are broad programs and more focused ones. I would say that typically a master’s degree is considered more broad than a PHD which is designed to hone in on one very specific piece in a field. But even among master’s degrees you see more broad ones: MS in Data Science (this was my program) or Analytics or Information and then you have MS in Data Analytics and Public Policy or MS in Computer Vision or MS in Quantitative Social Science.\nEvidentally, you can expect the broad ones to cover a wider range of topics and the other ones to take a stronger focus on one part of data science. But, the reality of data science is… it’s a super broad field with applications in most other fields. There are NLP data scientists, biology data scientist, public health data scientists, political data scientists, robotics data scientists, marketing data scientists, sports data scientists, and on and on. While subject knowledge is important in each of these applications of data science, often the methods are more similar than different. If you are convinced that you will only be in one corner of data science, perhaps it would be better to do a focused one, but for me, I was interested in exploring the field more so than choosing a corner.\nCost Price varies significantly from $10,000 total to +$100,000. My personal program ended up costing $40,000, but my salary more than doubled from the start to the end of the program, and the salary differential fully covered the cost of the program and more!\nTechnical Prerequisites Different programs are geared towards different crowds. Some will have no or very few prerequisites. Personally, these programs worried me because I assumed that programs with few prereqs would not cover topics in the technical depth I desired. I didn’t want a bunch of classes just covering things I already learned in my undergrad. I really wanted to learn afterall!\nMy specific program had 4 prerequisites at the time: Calculus I & II, Linear Algebra, and Programming in Python. I had already taken Calculus in school, but ended up taking community classes for Linear Algebra and Programming in Python.\nTechnical Depth of Program For those committed to a degree, I highly encourage you to look through the required courses in the program. Often, you can also find summaries and even syllubus’ for the classes in the program. A lot of programs that did not have prereqs also did not seem to have technical depth in classes. What drew me to my program was there was classes on all the topics I was interested in (Deep Learning, Bayesian Machine Learning, NLP, and also more engineering components such as Spark/Big Data and Data Structures & Algorithims).\nLooking back at my program, I am very pleased with the courses I took. I learned so much in most of them and was exposed to so many interesting things from computer vision to NLP to CS search algorithms that I had no idea about with my Political Science background.\nDecision: I decided on UVA because I was satisfied with the technical depth of the program, and the cost was not overwhelming in my position at the time. It offered the flexibility I was looking for and opportunities for connections amongst classmates and professors. I also appreciated how broad the courses were - covering many facets of data science throughout the program.\n\n\nReflections and Notes\nTip 1: Of everything, I wish I payed more attention to program outcomes. Answering questions like, where do the alumni work? Does my program feed into specific companies? This is a HUGE advantage of certain programs. For example, UVA feeds into Capital One and has strong contacts and connections there for graduates. If you were interested in working at Captial One, my program would be a great choice!\nIf I were to do everything over again, I’m not sure I would change anything. But, if I did, I would apply to certain programs that have strong big tech connections such as Berkeley, University of Washington, and several california schools. I may consider Georgia Tech’s program which has a strong reputation and only $10,000 for the total tuition cost.\nTip 2: My program was fully online. In truth, it was one the best online programs I could hope for. My cohort was ~30 students that I stuck with throughout the program. There were numerous group projects and assignments and I got to know the students in my cohort. With the relatively small class sizes, I also felt like I got to know several of my professors. Having said all of this, I felt like I had a better experience and developed better connections in my undergrad which was in-person. For these reasons, if I were to do it again, I would try to find an in-person program. Obviously, this may not be possible for everyone - some may want to work or are unable to relocate - but, I do think in-person provides a richer academic experience.\nTip 3: It can be helpful to just search around on LinkedIn and see the paths that current Data Scientist’s took to get where they are. Often, they do not have a Master’s Degree in Data Science, but have a degree in Phyisics or Computer Science or some other STEM field. In my opinion, most STEM degrees are seen as mostly equally viable in data science job candidates. So, if you are more interested in studying another STEM topic but working in Data Science, go study that topic and you can still get a job in DS!\n\n\nConclusion\nI hope this will help someone on their path with deciding whether to get more education or picking a progam. Please feel free to reach out if you want to chat. Also, if you feel like I missed something or you have something to share, comment below! I’d love to hear thoughts and ideas from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCheck out my companion piece to this discussing my path to data science from a social science background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "Resume Template with Quarto and LaTeX",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI made my first real resume about 7ish years ago. I used the templates they have at BYU, my alma mater. They are simple, clean, and I love them to this day!\nHowever, I wanted a way to help streamline my resume. It was getting tedious fidgeting around in the original word doc, exporting as a pdf, and then updating in all the other places I kept it. Additionally, I wanted more control over my resume than Microsoft Word was giving me and a more programmatic approach. All of these thoughts led me to Posit’s relatively new Quarto. Quarto is a flexible platform that can generate scientific reports and publish in a variety of formats (you can actually make websites with it too). So, I decided to give it a spin.\n\n\nImplementation\nI knew that it would likely be more work up front to create the bare bones structure, but less work on the backend when I would just add a thing or two. And, my hope was that other people interested in this format could use it as well in a few minutes without all the upfront work.\nYou can render the document side-by-side as you are writing it up which I found very helpful in whatever program you use to edit it.\n\nYou can also render the pdf from the .qmd from the code below.\n#In the terminal where the .qmd file is kept, run below to generate pdf:\nquarto render resume_alex.qmd --to pdf\nTurned out because I was most interested in the pdf export, I ended up using mostly LaTeX and only some plain Markdown in my Quarto document. Though I haven’t experimented with exporting to html, I noticed that I wasn’t able to export to word when using custom LaTeX. My template can only be fully rendered in pdf form which is fine for my interests. But, for those interested in a Microsoft Word or html output, my template may not work for you.\nFinished product below… (also check out my cv tab on this website for the pdf; below is just a screenshot)\n\nHow did it turn out? Do you like my resume?\nOverall, I am happy how it turned out and happy to save some time. Feel free to clone/fork the repository where I have my resume for your personal use.\nIf you would like to clone the repo, copy the code below in the terminal. Then just update the files to have your resume information!\ngit clone https://github.com/acbass49/CV_Quarto.git\n\n\nTips if you try it\n\n\nI put comments throughout the .qmd document outlining where all the parts of the resume are, so should be able to update text and copy and paste sections as necessary.\n\n\nLike I mentioned above, most of this is built with LaTeX, so if you want to further customize, you will want to be googling how to do something in LaTeX. The only part that is in Markdown are the bulleted lists.\n\n\nI would recommend using RStudio as the tool for working with Quarto (same company built both), but as I use VScode a lot these days, I figured I would give Quarto’s VScode plug-in a try. Overall, I really liked the plug-in. Notably, you can render the .qmd document (as docx, pdf, html) in the window next to you which was very helpful. I believe this is the same for RStudio as well.\n\n\nAs a bonus, in the repository I have a shell script where you can see what actions I take to upload the new resume to my personal system and blog, and update the repositories.\n\n\nFeel free to comment below if you have questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs you probably know, Google Analytics has changed and become more complicated to the dismay of many people (now called Google Analytics 4). Recently, There have also been government bans over privacy concerns from Google Analytics. I am not extremely knowlegdable about all things data privacy, but really just wanted another analytics platform that was simple and delivered what I needed to track traffic ethically on this website you are on now.\nAlso, looking at the quarto docs, there is a place to initialize google analytics, but does not mention other services. So, I thought I would share this short article as an example of using another service for those who might be interested.\n\n\nSimple Analytics\nSimple Analytics was easy to set up and delivers exactly what I wanted to see in a clean dashboard that worked out of the box. There are options to customize specific goals or events of special interest. Also, they have the option of sending a weekly email summary of visiting stats.\nIf you have a quarto website, I simply added the excerpt below to my _quarto.yml file. This uses the body-footer argument which accepts the required html snippet for the service. And that’s it! This will include the html in every page on the website, so the traffic for every page will be tracked.\nwebsite:\n    body-footer: |\n        &lt;!-- 100% privacy-first analytics --&gt;\n        &lt;script async defer src=\"https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com/latest.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com/noscript.gif\" alt=\"\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;\nAfter this is inserted and you set up an account, it starts automatically tracking everything in your dashboard. Here is an example of what mine looks like:\n\nIt has most visitor data fields you might be interested in like Country, pages visited, referral, device type and browser.\nThere is a subscription required after a 14 day trial period which is $8 a month with an annual subscription. This may not be worth it to some people, but just sharing a simple solution that I found helpful. I beleive that there is a basic free version after the trial period ends, but not sure what this entails.\nIf you would like to see an implementation in my quarto website, feel free to browse my repository here and remember to look for the _quarto.yml file!\nLet me know of thoughts or questions below…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

If so, which?\n\n\nDo factors like living in a rich vs. poor area, predominantly white area, or other demographic factors change the likelihood of gun violence in schools?\n\n\nWhat effect, if any, do various gun laws already in-place have on school shootings?\n\n\nIn this post, I try to show the data behind a few of these questions in as non-partisan a way as possible.\n\n\nData\nAfter the Uvalde school shooting earlier this year, I saw a short article on USAFacts about school shootings. They made a figure visualizing trends from a rich dataset from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This dataset has a record of every school shooting in the last 50 years as well as interesting variables such as links to news articles, approximate number of shots fired, description of the event, and the school where it happened.\nFrom the city variable, I matched cities to counties and aggregated the shootings by county, so you could see how many school shootings were in each county in the US the last 50 years. From this point, I joined in several county-level datasets mostly from the census and a few other sources which have information like average income, percent educated at various levels, race, unemployment rate, laws, etc. all at the county level.\n\n\nLimitations\nFirst, it’s important to understand that school shootings in this dataset include…\n\n“all incidents in which a gun is brandished or fired or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims (including zero), time, day of the week, or reason (e.g., planned attack, accidental, domestic violence, gang-related).” - NCES\n\nThis opens up wiggle room because perhaps the incident wasn’t very severe (e.g. if there was only brandishing) and perhaps these account for a lot of the dataset. Turns out, as seen here (comparing fig2 and fig3 in this article) the majority of incidents result in at least one injury/deceased person. Also, for every record of school shootings, we have a description of the event which you can browse here if interested. I found when looking through that most of these cases seem like significant incidents. Besides, even in an incident where there was brandishing (threateningly waving a gun around) and no casualties, it would likely still be a impactful/scary incident for the child and parents. I also believe a similar thing for many accidental occurrences which could also be impactful/scary. For these reasons, I include all these cases in my analysis.\nNext, it is worth noting that because there are incidents that were perhaps never reported in some areas. This could lead to some bias especially if one region was significantly less likely to report incidents. However, in my mind, most areas should have a similar negative incentive to not report something like this because every school with a shooting looks bad whether in New Hampshire, South Carolina, or any other state.\nAlright now for our questions…\n\n\nHow often do school shootings happen? Is the rate increasing or decreasing?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we have simply the raw counts of all school shootings in the last 50 years. It’s pretty clear that the rate is increasing. Also, if you only look at deaths and injuries fig2 at this link, both of the trends - number of deaths and number of injuries from school shootings - seem to be increasing as well.\nTo give you a sense of how often these happen: if there are 130,000 schools in the US, and just over 250 shooting incidents this last year, your child’s school has about a r round(250/130000*100, 1)% chance of seeing a shooting which is about 1 in 500. To put this in perspective, the odds of dying in a car crash is 1 in 114 and the odds of dying in a plane crash is 1 in 9,821 (according to this random website), so somewhere in between there i guess😂.\nThough I won’t spend any more time on this question now, fig 2 in this article details information about the shooters intent which I find interesting.\n\n\nAre gun violence incidents concentrated in particular regions in America? If so, which?\n\n\n\n\n\nJust from looking at the counts by region, gun incidents overall are more likely to occur in south - in a trend that has stayed consistent for the past 30 years. The gap between the south and the other regions seems to have grown wider in the past two years whereas before the south counts seemed only a little bit higher than the other regions.\nUsing my model, I generated predictions for all US counties below where we can see where the model predicts areas of higher concentration across the US. Hover to find the exact prediction for your county!\n\n\n\nGenerally, I feel the biggest take-away from the map above is that more populated counties are more likely to have school shootings which makes sense. For example, WY and the Dakotas have a low population and are not predicted to have many, but coastal areas such as CA are darker (meaning more predicted school shootings).\nBut, population isn’t the only factor, there does seem to be some hot spots, take Michigan and South Carolina for example. The map shows those two states seem darker in more areas than just their cities. These darker spots in less populated area are due to other factors that affect school shooting which we will talk a little more about in the next section.\n\n\nDo factors like living in a rich vs. poor area, predominantly white area, or other demographic factors change the likelihood of a school shooting?\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology note: For those interested, I estimated the model using Bayesian techniques (MCMC-style sampling in estimating the posterior distribution). I tested several models, but saw the best performance (best WAIC score) using a state-level random-intercepts negative-binomial regression. More info and code I used in github.\nHere is a table of selected features in my model (some are not included here for brevity’s sake). There are three easy ways to interpret this table: First, is it positive of negative? Positive numbers increase the number of school shootings while negative numbers decrease. Next, how big is the Mean relative to the others? With bigger numbers, the model estimates it has a bigger effect on school shootings and vice versa for smaller numbers. And, thirdly, Is the feature starred? We are more confident in the estimates of the starred features and not as confident in those that are not.\nSignificantly, the biggest starred feature is percent black in a county. The coefficient is high and it is starred. The direct interpretation of this model is we are around r round(exp(0.62))x as likely to see a shooting in counties as we increase 1 standard deviation in percent black in a county when controlling for the other features in the model. There is no effect for the other races.\nAnother interesting tidbit is what doesn’t seem to matter. In our model, all of the education variables (some are not included in this table) and the income variable do not have a star indicating there is no clear relationship - in essence, wealthy counties and educated counties seem to be just as likely to have school shootings than poor counties and non-educated counties. It is possible that this could not be true for counties that are both poor and uneducated, but I didn’t test this relationship specifically. Also, I don’t have a measure of income disparity here which could be significant. For example, a county that has a lot of really poor people and a lot of really rich people may have the same median income as a county with a lot of middle income people. I suspect this might be the case because we are confident counties with high unemployment rates are more likely to have school shootings (coefficient is positive and starred).\nOne last thing I’ll mention is that counties with more people are more likely to see school shootings, but these aren’t necessarily correlated to how urban/rural an area is. This is contrary to my prior belief about this.\n\n\nWhat effect, if any, do various gun laws (already in-place) have on school shootings?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom looking at the raw counts, while noisy, we can see that generally counties with state laws for universal background checks and gun permit laws see lower numbers for school shootings.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when controlling for other variables in our model, we are not confident that these laws have a positive effect on curbing gun violence in schools. For universal background checks, our model actually estimates a slight positive relationship, which could suggest that gun permit laws are more effective than background check laws at curbing violence in schools. This is also seen in the fivethirtyeight score - where there is no conclusive relationship between gun law strictness and state scores.\nMethodology note: Because of my model specification, I was only able to include a snapshot in time of state gun laws, so I included what the universal and gun permit laws were as of 2016; but, this data includes incidents from the past 50 years. I used a snapshot of gun laws with the assumption that states in the past 50 years with stricter laws generally continued to have stricter laws through the time period and vice versa. The object of this model and post is only to get a general overview and not a deep dive analysis on the effectiveness of gun laws, but perhaps I will do this in the future.\n\n\nConclusion\nMy personal takeaways from the analysis:\n\n\nThere seems to be evidence that gun violence is increasing in schools - especially in the last 3 years. Injuries, deaths, and non-fatal incidents have all increased.\n\n\nCounties with a 1 standard deviation of a higher black population are twice as likely to see school shootings. Whereas, rich counties and educated counties are just as likely as non-rich and non-educated counties to see school shootings.\n\n\nWe saw lower trends in shootings among states that had stricter gun laws when looking at the counts, but when we controlled for other variables, these effects went away. I noted, though, with our model we choose, it is good at getting a general overview of relationships, but a different model might be better at parsing out directly the effectiveness of these gun laws. So, I would say our findings here are overall inconclusive.\n\n\nHopefully, you’ve learned a thing or two at best to have more context into our gun control controversy and at worst to have something to keep the conversation going at dinner tonight (and keep it spicy because you would be discussing politics).\nFeel free to message me with questions about the methodology or anything else or comment below! I have all my code at this repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "7 Facts You May Not Know About Latter-Day Saints",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, I found myself reading a book by Jana Riess entitled The Next Mormons. It challenged some of my thoughts, and I generally found it interesting, so I wanted to share some thoughts here. Feel free to comment at the bottom of the page in the chat box and share your thoughts too (I just figured out how to add those to the bottom of my posts, so try it out!).\nThe premise of the book is describing findings from a survey of 1,156 Latter-day Saints and 540 former Latter-day Saints fielded September 8 - November 21, 2016 from an online panel (more methodology here if interested). I have shared data before from a more recent survey with Latter-day Saints, but this survey was unique because it was only a sample of Latter-day Saints and the survey questions were focused only on Latter-day Saints’ experiences and specifically Millennials (yeah I know… I found my niche truly as I am a survey-analyst, Millennial, Latter-day Saint). It reads very academic and summarizes both quantitative figures in charts and qualitative in-person interviews in the written text. Although the survey took place what is now almost 5 years ago, I find the content relevant and interesting now. So if the only church numbers you hear are from the Church Audit Report around General Conference time, you may be in the same place as I was.\n\n\nFact 1 : The percent of Latter-day Saints who have served missions has increased\n\n\n\n\n\nThis particular fact wasn’t extremely surprising to me - especially the fact that many more millennial women have served missions because of the age change. I think the reason I wanted to point this one out is that I didn’t realize that a higher percentage of members in general serve missions nowadays. Keep in mind that the Boomer/Silent generation number includes those who have joined later in life who did not have the opportunity to serve as a young missionary; however, the Boomer/Silent generation may also include those who served later in life which younger Latter-day saints have not had the opportunity to.\n\nFact 2 : There are generational divides on when it is ok to NOT wear garments\n\n\n\n\n\nTo me, this is interesting because Millennials are less likely than Boomer/Silents to have exceptions for wearing the garments except for “When ill or when there is a medical reason.” This makes enough sense as older groups would be more likely to be in situations where they are ill or when there is a medical reason where as for younger folks the situation may not have come up yet. Another interesting tidbit here is that 1/5 millennials excuse wearing garments when sleeping and on vacation when Boomer/Silents do not which I wasn’t necessarily expecting. I was expecting this behavior, but didn’t think there would be generational divides.\n\n\nFact 3 : Less than half of Millennial Latter-day Saints hold current temple recommends\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been portions of my life when I haven’t held a temple recommend, but I think my perception here was that most people had temple recommends. If anything, this was comforting to me knowing that not only do many people not have temple recommends currently, but many people have never held a temple recommend. I think I am impressed by the many people who continue to participate in the religion while not having access to the temple which is probably one of the coolest and most unique aspects of the religion. I honestly wish I had access to the data in this case just to see different breaks here. Are there any differences in gender, Utah/nonUtah, convert/grew up in the church?\n\n\nFact 4 : Having premarital sexual relations are just as likely regardless of age married\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile access to data for nation wide trends is much more readily available for sexual habits / activity (for example, the CDC collects a bunch of data on this if anyone is interested), it is not so much available for small subgroups like Latter-day Saints. This is especially interesting because premarital sexual experience is considered sinful by the LDS church which may discourage members from sharing these things with others which means that it probably is especially difficult to get a sense of how prevalent these behaviors are among members of the church. For me, this breakdown of premarital sexual experience is not necessarily surprising; however, it is surprising that those who are never married and those who are currently married have nearly the same percentage of people in each group. There is an exception for masturbation which is higher among the Latter-day Saints who have never married.\nLatter-day Saints may be cautious reporting these behaviors since they are against church standards, but it is also an anonymous internet-based survey which would eliminate the interviewer effect and create a more open environment for sharing with candidness.\n\n\nFact 5 : Many more millennial Latter-day saint mothers worked outside the home than Silent/Boomer Mothers\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was something that was surprising to me. While this trend is very clear in America - more American women work full-time now than ever before - it is also bleeding over into Latter-day Saint culture as well. More than 1/2 Millennial Latter-day saints grew up with a mother that worked. It would also be interesting to see whether more Latter-day Saint millennial parents were divorced than for other generations, but again, I am only limited to the data that is written about in the book. This is an interesting trend in Latter-day Saint culture and may suggest shifting in what a family means compared to what it was for Silent/Boomers.\n\n\nFact 6 : Many Latter-day Saints have not returned to the temple for the deceased after own work is done\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was also quite interesting to me. When I served my Latter-day Saint mission in Salt Lake City, Utah, I several people who never returned to the temple after receiving their endowments, but I wasn’t expecting more than 4 in 10 GenXers and Millennials not returning to the temple. Seeing that more Silent/Boomers have returned to the temple is not surprising as they both have more time to do it (being alive longer), may be retired with more time in the day, and I know many older Latter-day Saint folks who attend the temple regularly.\n\n\nFact 7 : General demographic profile of a former Latter-day Saint\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these things were not super interesting to me other than one group. It turns out that those who are less educated are more likely to leave the church. One prominent theory in political science literature is that as a society gets more educated, it will also become less religious and more secular. This trend is clearly seen in Europe, but the US has been interestingly resistant to this trend. And recently researchers are finding that college going Americans aren’t necessarily led away from religion. An opposite effect is also found in the Next Mormons Survey where college goers are more likely to stay active.\nThere were many more interesting facts in the book and I only included a small subset of things I found interesting here, so I would encourage you to check it out if you are interested in the changing landscape of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in America. She also just funded a kick starter campaign for funding for another survey focused on former Mormons and why they leave the church which will also be interesting.\nThanks for reading!

    "title": "Google Trends Can Measure Discrimination?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro\nA few questions that social scientists have been asking for a while are… how do you measure something like discrimination? How do you measure the intensity of discrimination? Also, is it possible to generalize this to a population? For example, X group is strongly discriminated against in the United States, or X group is strongly discriminated against in the world.\n\n\nMeasures\n\nMethod 1: You might be able to do this with laws. For example, if there are laws based on race in a community, then discrimination is clearer. But in a country like the US, as you go out from a local level, there exist more and more laws, thousands! It seems difficult to go law by law through thousands of laws searching for discrimination. Also, this type of search doesn’t account for people who may discriminate against others outside the law.\nMethod 2: Social scientists try to use series of survey questions to detect attitudes towards discrimination of race and gender, but who wants to admit things like being racist or sexist? Even subtle attitude questions about discrimination could be detected by the survey respondent.\n\nIf you’re like me, these both don’t seem like great measures and have plenty of room for error. This is definitely not an exhaustive list of possible measures, but none come to mind that are reliable, accurate, and can be applied to large regions or populations. If I misssed some, feel free to comment below..\n\n\nAnother Measurement\nRecently, I read a book by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz entitled, “Everybody Lies : Big Data, New Data, And What The Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are.” He shares interesting facts and trends from what he calls the “digital truth serum,” Google Search data.\nHe proposes that we lie all the time to our friends, neighbors, family, and even to ourselves. But, there is one person we don’t lie to… GOOGLE. Using google trends data, we can see how often people searched a certain term over time and compare it with other searches. While the book overall was interesting and would recommend it to others, I want to focus on one particular part.\nOne interesting fact about google searches is people often declare statements/confessions - not questions - on google searches. For example, they might say “I’m pregnant” or “I’m gay.” Even dark things like, “I hate myself” or “I wanna kill myself.” It really is a gold mine of interesting data that doesn’t have filters like words your friend might say to you or how a survey respondent might answer.\nIn his book, he discusses a paper he wrote linking Google searches for “nigger jokes” and “nigger” to election differences in the US for Obama.\nAll of this led my to my own question and query. Perhaps one other avenue in looking for individuals most discriminated against is using google search data like Seth Stephens-Davidowitz.\nSo, I made a chart for google search data using statements for “kill [group]” specifically in the US. The results surprised me in several respects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is the frequency of searches of these exact words. These are not the frequency of searches that contained these words!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you are a mobile viewer, the aggregation is by year instead of by month. You can see some of the trends, but the histogram doesn’t display referenced in Observation 2 and you can’t see the monthly seasonal trends referenced in Observation 3. I recommend you view on desktop if possible 🙏\n\n\n\nObservation 1:\nOne of the first things that catches the eye is the spikes in the different colored lines. The highest spike is of the “kill blacks” line which is in June 2020. This was also the same time that the BLM marches and videos of looting were circulating which tracks. Also check out this link from BBC which documents several of the police shootings of African Americans - several of which correspond to spikes on the graph.\nIf you hover, you can see the “kill chinese” line spikes in March 2020 and has stayed a bit higher than before ever since. You hopefully know the reason for this spike.\nThe “kill muslims” line spikes in November 2015 the same time was when the paris attacks occurred.\nNoticing and researching spikes helps reaffirm our claims about statements. The times when anomosity might be highest toward a group in the US group is also when “kill [insert group]” line spikes. Also, I didn’t name them all feel free to reseach some yourself you see on the graph!\n\n\nObservation 2:\nOne of the overall takeways I got from this figure is the little histogram to the left hand side which gives an average relative interest overall. I’m not sure which group I was expecting to be the highest, but I didn’t think it was the “kill jews” search. This search seems to be almost twice as likely as the second higest which is the “kill chinese” score. Followed by the “kill muslims” score, the “kill blacks,” and lastly, the “kill gays” score. You can only compared 5 at a time, but I also tried including other groups which were lower than these including “kill christians,” “kill mormons,” and a few others. “Kill whites” was similar to “kill muslims” in frequency and followed similar spike patterns to “kill blacks,” but on a lesser scale.\nLooking at the histogram, this suggested to me that Jews and Chinese are perhaps more discriminated against today than I previously had thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are a mobile viewer, there is no histogram, but if you imagine taking the average by google search Jews obviously has the highest number, so on.\n\n\n\n\nObservation 3:\nOne thing that i find very interesting about this graph is the cyclical pattern of the “kill jews” search. It seems to follow a yearly pattern beginning at a low point in July / August then spiking in April. I don’t fully understand why this pattern exists, but perhaps it could be related to Easter - which is in April - when the Jews crucified Jesus Christ, a central figure in Christian religions (a lot of the US is Christian). This theory wouldn’t explain the gradual rising though, so if you have suggestions of why this is the case, please email me or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are a mobile viewer, you’ll just have to trust me on this one 🙂.\n\n\n\n\nObservation 4:\nWhile it does seem the US has more distaste for jews, chinese, and muslims, still note that African - Americans and gay people are still on the map. All of this is according to our measure using Google Search data, of course.\n\n\n\nTakeaways\nThis is by no means a perfect measure of discrimination against a group, how many people really are searching for this type of thing? Also, it would be so valuable to see demographic breaks by searches. But concerns aside, I think it is a new and interesting take on measure of discrimination and distaste for a particular group. And perhaps it is a valuable signal because of the spikes we see that correlate with real events that might cause more hate/discrimination for a particular group.\nIf we believe for a second that it is a good measure, we may consider groups we may not hear about in the news as much as subjects of American discrimination (jews, chinese, and muslims) more than we give credit for.\nFeel free to leave relevant and thoughtful comments below 🙂\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

    "title": "Latter-Day Saints: Growing Pains In The GOP",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBetween Mitt Romney’s nomination in 2012 and present times, the Republican Party has seen shifts in make-up and goals. In 2016, Trump tapped into a somewhat different base than previous Republicans - appealing strongly to non-college whites. Policy-wise, Trump has been more aggressive with border-controls, pushing domestic production, and tougher on some foreign players like China. But, while some groups have been more supportive of the evolving GOP platform, others have drifted further from it.\nLatter-day Saints (Mormons) are perhaps a good example of this. In Utah’s 2016 presidential vote cast, Evan McMullin - a third-party candidate - won more than 1/5 of Utah’s ballots. Even in the 2020 election, while many more Utahns supported Trump than in 2016, Trump only garnered 58% of the votes (compared to Romney’s 73% in 2012).\nIn this post, I am interested in diving further into Latter-day Saint political trends and learning of possible pressure points for them in the new GOP.\n\n\n\nData\nThe Democracy Fund and UCLA released data from one of the largest public opinion surveys ever conducted including 156,000 cases collected from July 2019–July 2020. More info on this here. After combining these surveys, I was able to get a large Latter-day Saint sample of n=3787.\n\n\n\nSo… What did I find?\nLet’s first take a look at a few summary statistics to see how Latter-day Saints break out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike previous studies have found, Latter-day Saints are a much more Republican group when compared to the United States in general; however, 1 in 4 Latter-day Saints identify or lean Democrat.\n(Side note: In these figures, Republicans and Democrats include those who identify with the Republican/Democrat Party AND those who initially identify as Independent, but then say they vote/lean more Republican than Democrat or vice versa. This may seem like a confusing practice, but it is common for data to be reported this way because some scholars find Independent leaners behave almost indistinguishably from regular partisans. Typically, when others visualize party break data, they will specify whether leaners are included.)\nSo, what does this look like over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this figure, we can see more Latter-day Saints identified and leaned Republican in 2014 than in both 2007 and 2019-20. This isn’t too surprising as the Republican nominee in 2012 was Mitt Romney, a Latter-day Saint. But, as we hypothesized, the number of Republican Latter-day Saints in 2019-20 has not only dropped lower than 2014, but also perhaps lower than it was previously in 2007. Also, more Latter-day Saints are identifying as Democrats (+6 from 2014).\nI would have included more snapshots of Latter-day Saint party identification over time, but because they only make up ~1.5% of the population, it can be hard to find data with sufficient sample sizes to make inferences about their population. Thankfully, Pew Research Center every so often puts out the “Religious Landscape Study” with a large enough sample to study smaller religious groups. I used this study to fill in the 2007 and 2014 data points in the figure above.\n\n\n\nWhy Are We Seeing A Decrease In Latter-day Saint Republicans?\nIn the Nationscape Survey, respondents were asked a series of policy questions from healthcare, to economics, to legalization of marijuana. Seeing how Latter-day Saints respond to these questions may give us some insight as to why we are seeing some Latter-day Saints leave the Republican Party.\nShown below are the issues where Latter-day Saints had the largest percentage point differences from Republicans in the Democratic direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, all of these issues are related. Four of the five policies are about immigration, and all of them have been supported by Trump (or were actions he took). The biggest point difference between Republicans and Latter-day Saints - building the Mexico wall - was a central focus in Trump’s 2016 campaign platform and something he pushed throughout his presidency. In this, we see Latter-day Saints showing resistance to key Trump policies and actions with foreign players (as seen in many disagreeing on imposing tariffs on China) which suggests some distaste for Trump.\nLatter-day Saints also noticeably lean left on immigration issues. As it turns out, our immigration finding is nothing new. Others have noted this and especially among Latter-day Saints who served foreign church service missions (usually 1.5-2 years in duration). But, to me, the main takeaway from this figure is Latter-day Saints reveal at least one way why they are hesitant toward Trump: his stance on immigration.\nWe also may see distaste for Trump in this impeachment question.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 1 in 4 Latter-day Saints agreed with this compared to almost 3 in 4 Democrats. However, even though Latter-day Saints are much closer to Republicans than Democrats on impeaching Trump, Latter-day Saints actually are almost twice as far from Republicans on this issue as they are on average(more on averages in the next section). In that, we see more evidence of some Latter-day Saint hesitancy toward Trump.\n\n\n\nSo Why Do Latter-day Saints Stick Around With The GOP?\nIt is important to note that while the figure above shows the largest point deviations from Republicans, Latter-day Saints still don’t match Democrat levels of agreement on ANY issue analyzed in this survey (though some issues Latter-day Saints are fairly close to Democrats like “imposing tariffs on china”). Most of the time, Latter-day Saints are closely aligned with Republican agreement levels, and sometimes they agree more in the Republican direction on issues than Republicans themselves. A full list of policies questions and agree percentages is found here.\nI created a below table describing the average difference between each group’s responses to the various policy questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Republicans and Latter-days Saints are a lot closer together than Democrats and Latter-day Saints on average policy agreement levels. In fact, on average Latter-day Saints and Democrats are almost as far apart as Republicans and Democrats.\nLet’s dive more into what these numbers mean. Among the policy questions that were asked, for example, “Should we raise taxes on families making over $600,000?” If 40% of Republicans agreed with this statement, Latter-day Saints agreeing would on average fall 6 points apart of 40%, so perhaps Latter-day Saints would report 46% agreeing. And Democrats would fall at 26 points away on average, so perhaps 66% of Democrats agree. This just shows that policy-wise Latter-day Saints were significantly closer to Republicans than Democrats on average. The actual numbers for this question are 76% of Democrats, 51% of Republicans, and 49% of Latter-days Saints agree.\nOn most all other issues - healthcare, size of government, family values - Latter-day Saints are closely aligned to the Republican Party.\nBut enough on this.\n\n\n\nWhat Issues Exactly Do Latter-day Saints Lean the Furthest Right?\nAnother reason Latter-day Saints stick around is shown in the next figure. Below are the issues where Latter-day Saints leaned the furthest RIGHT by percentage point. These could represent the conservative positions Latter-day Saints cling to most strongly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI belieive Latter-day Saints stick around because some church teachings are closely aligned with conservative policy positions.\nFor example, it is a commandment for Latter-day Saints not to use marijuana recreationally. The Latter-day Saint prophet has also taught abortion to be wrong except in special cases (rape, incest, and mother’s life). Some teachings - like these - are directly aligned with conservative positions on social freedoms.\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nThat last bit helped convince me that not only are Latter-day Saints sticking around right now, but also I don’t anticipate any large movements of Latter-day Saints to the Democratic Party in near future. I say this because while there are evidences of Latter-day Saint growing pains in the Republican Party with Trump and new stances on immigration, these simply won’t overpower the long tradition of Latter-day Saint voting patterns. The church itself doesn’t choose sides, but Latter-day Saints have traditionally voted for policies that restrict social freedoms to boundaries consistent with church teachings.\nHowever unlikely, I think it is possible that this tradition changes. I could potentially see a world where Latter-day Saints applied prophetic teachings in their personal lives, and voted for many socially liberal policies as the GOP continued to hit more pressure points and elect more Trumps. I don’t think this will happen, but I do believe that the evolving GOP platform has got at least a few Latter-day Saints thinking about some of this.\nThanks for reading!

    "title": "So Yep… I Made Another Election Model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are a lot of election models out there - fivethirtyeight, The Cook Political Report, and Decision Desk to name a few. So what am I doing here?\n\n\nTLDR\nView my personal election model in my dashboard 👉👉 here 👈👈\n\n\nThe Problem\nWell, it may be the start of a tradition at this point since I did one last US presidential election and I thought it actually performed quite well (election was close; my latest simulations also close). But, in the end, I created this because I felt like I was blindly trusting other’s models without understanding them. Many election model builders claim to use demographic patterns, previous election results, economic considerations, polls, etc.. But, beside polling numbers, what data exactly are they using and where does it come from? Also, what do their models actually look like? Ideally, I would want enough information to recreate the model myself to see what they actually did, but that information is rarely available.\n\n\nWhat I did\nMy goal was to create a model that is based exclusively on recent quality polling, and that’s it! No mysterious variables thrown into already complex models; no sensitive consumer data that feels like violations of privacy; and, no blindly trusting an invisible methodology where you can’t possibly recreate the model. Since I finished data science school within the last four years, I decided to take a more rigourous approach than last time which I write about here and code up here. Overall, the purpose is to give an educated guess of what would happen if the election were held each day. I also just like this kinda thing 😂.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe dashboard is part of an automated data pipeline that updates each day until the election. So check back soon! Each day at around 5am, the charts are updated with the latest quality polling data.\n\n\nSo, thanks for viewing this post! Check back soon for more updates on the dashboard. Feel free to share thoughts, comments, or your predictions below in the comments section at the end of the page. Below, I included a few notes with more info on each graph in the dashboard in layman’s terms.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Technical and Graph Notes\n\nI simulate the election 50,000 times each day based off of modeled probabilities of Trump winnin each state. The model isn’t necessarily a forecast because I am simulating the election as if it were held the present day.\nNotice that you still see both candidates win some simulations. Even though one outcome may be more likely, don’t count the other out!\n\n\nHistogram Notes\n\nSee how the histogram of daily EC vote distribution is more spikey than smooth? This is because some outcomes with even 1 EC point difference can be more likely given how state groupings naturally divide out.\n\n\n\nChoropleth Map Notes\n\nWatch states like Georgia and Arizona closely which had unexpected results last election. Also, keep an eye on light colored states where the winner is more uncertain!\nDistricts from States using the congressional district method are not included on the map, but they are included in the model!\n\n\n\nWin Perc. Over Time Graph Notes\n\nI decided to create a confidence interval around the final graph of win percentages per candidate tracked over time. To accomplish this, I take 1000 samples of the simulations (n=100) and record the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of the sample means. This is by no means a perfect measure for a confidence interval, but should provide a sense of possible win percentages day by day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to be notified for new posts?

Then, I asked questions about whether they saw it, and if so, did they detected any political messages.

    "title": "Star Wars: Political Message Detection & Likeability",
    "section": "What I Found…",
    "text": "What I Found…\nOf the 1000 I surveyed, 361 had seen the movie. Here are some stats about them…\n\nThe individuals who watched Star Wars skewed male, older, and higher income. Given a simple t-test, there was no significant difference in party affiliation, voting in the last election, and education. Of the 361 watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi 80 identified a political message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMany of these were ordinal scale questions, so that is why the numbers look a bit weird. For example, looking at the party variable, Democrats were coded as 1, Independents were coded at 2, and Republicans were coded as 3. So, an average of above 2 means there were more Republicans in that particular group and lower than 2 means there were more democrats. See the paper for more detailed information on these questions.\n\n\nFrom this point, I wanted to evaluate whether political message detection led to a decrease in likeability of the film. So, I fit a linear regression model using several demographic variables with the variable of interest using a 10 point scale of likeability as the dependent variable. From this model, I found that it had an effect at the 90% confidence level. The interpretation being… if a political message was detected by the respondent, my model predicts that person rates it 0.5 points lower on the likeability scale.\nThe second part is digging further into the types of messages that were detected and by what party…\n\nFrom this figure, we see that Republicans were less likely to detect a poltical message than Independents and Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe error bars are not visible for the point estimates for Democrats and Independents because of a larger N size than Republicans. There is more uncertainty in the true estimate of Star Wars fans detecting a political message given the lower number of Repulicans responding to the survey.\n\n\n\nThis figure shows the counts of each category and what type of message they detected. From the figure, it seems like everyone seemed to detect more democratic messages than republican messages; however, I really need a larger sample to tell because only 7 republicans in the sample saw the movie and detected a political message.\nPerhaps unneccessary, but to get actual estimated probabilities of each person being in this group, I fit a multinomial logistic regression on the dependent variable of the type of political message the respondent detected: Republican, Democrat, or unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNo, this graph wasn’t made in R. This model was estimated and the figure was made in Stata for those social science folks who can tell by its distinct style 😂"

    "text": "Evaluating My Hypotheses\nHypthesis 1: detecting political messages in a film would have a negative impact on the respondents likeability of the film This was somewhat true - my model estimated that those that detected a political message liked the film 0.5 points less on a 10 point scale. This finding was significant at the 90% confidence level controlling for demographic characteristics.\nHypthesis 2: Partisans are sensitive to out-party messages. For example, Republicans would more readily recognize Democratic messaging and vice versa. From the data I have, this really wasn’t true. It seems that across the board, respondents from all parties generally identified more Democratic messages than otherwise. Having more statistical power would be helpful, but the numbers we have clearly go against my original hypothesis - especially for democrats who identified many more democratice messages than republican ones."

    "text": "Reflections From a Few Years Down the Road…\nI worked really hard on this project and am honestly proud of the work I did. However, that doesn’t mean that If I were to do it now, I wouldn’t change things. Here’s what I would change:\n\nAs much as I love Star Wars, it would be more interesting if the project was generalizable to other movies. I could have asked about the most recent movie the respondent has seen. I would have gotten more respondents watching movies and been able to have more statistical power for my estimates (only 37% of the sample had seen Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker). If I chose the route above, it would have also been interesting to dive into what genres of which people are more willing to hear political messages. The tradeoff would be, though, I wouldn’t know some fun stats about the demographics of Star Wars movie watchers that I now know 😂\nIt would have been good to use typical survey techniques to account for the non-representative nature of my sample. My sample skewed more interested in the news and more democratic than the US population which is typical of online samples. It would be interesting to experiment with weighting in the tabs I reported and perhaps in my statistical models as well. Using quotas when fielding would also help with the sample quality. These are things I wasn’t thinking about at the time, but now dealing with surveys at my work for some time, this is where my mind goes.\n\nWhat do you think? Hopefully, you learned something about Star Wars and politics you didn’t know before."

As an example, here is what Target.com looked like in March 2, 2000:\n \n\nOur project does not deal with the webpages, but focuses on the other resources that the Internet Archive offers - specifically their collection of books (over 7 million as of July 2023). Our contacts wanted to match the books in the Internet Archive to books cited on Wikipedia.\nWhat are the implications of this? Well, if you were researching a topic and came across a book, you could gain access to a FREE copy of this book given a link to the internet achive in the wikipedia citation of your article. Given the vast collection of books in the Internet Archive, this could be a huge asset to the world providing free resources to everyone visiting Wikipedia."
