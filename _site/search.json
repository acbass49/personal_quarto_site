    "text": "So, Cue In My Project..\nRight when I think I don’t have to worry about COVID anymore, I find myself once again clicking through a website checking case, death, and vaccination rates. Instead of this, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data, so you can be informed with raw data on a weekly check-in basis nationally and for your state.\n\n\nEmail Structure\nAt the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national and your state’s vaccination rates are.\nAttached to the email are two visualizations showing the data trends across time: one showing national trend, the other showing your state’s trend (they look similar to the figure below 👇)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne note: To get the vaccination rate for each state and nationally, I compared the number vaccinated against the TOTAL population (not just 18+ or 12+). I got the state population numbers from the census, and count is included in the figures for reference. I decided to use the total US population because I think that will eventually be relevant as more age groups are approved for various vaccines. If you are interested in different numbers, I have a link with more information included in the weekly email.\nThe code is not viewable for this project because of email privacy, but happy to share code snippets for personal inquiries. Thanks for stopping in.\n\n\nEmbedded Survey Form\nIf you are interested in receiving this brief weekly update, drop your email in below… You can only submit after answering both questions!\n\nLoading…"

    "text": "There are a lot of election models out there - the Economist, FiveThirtyEight, and the Cook Political Report to name a few. So what am I doing here?\n\n\nThe Problem\nHonestly, I was irritated in blindly trusting other’s models. Many election model builders claim to use demographic patterns, previous election results, economic considerations, polls, etc.. But, beside polling numbers, what data exactly are they using and where does it come from? Also, what do their models actually look like? Ideally, I would want enough information to recreate the model myself to see what they actually did, but that information isn’t available. I understand that model-builders may not want to be undermined and critiqued by skeptics where their work may lose credibility to egotistic data lords or others, but even-so I would appreciate more transparency (especially after the 2016 election). Also, I understand that the data that are used may be sensitive information they pay for which is more understandable.\n\n\nWhat I did\nMy goal was to create a model that is based exclusively on recent quality polling, and that’s it! No mysterious variables thrown into already complex models; no sensitive consumer data that feels like violations of privacy; and, no blindly trusting an invisible methodology where you can’t possibly recreate the model. These probabilities are calculated SOLELY from an average of the five latest, quality polls in each state. Here is my methodology and code. Overall, the purpose is to give an educated guess of what would happen if the election were held each week (I plan to update this each day until the election). I mostly did this for an easy way to keep track of the recent polls and pulse check the election map looks at a moments notice.\n\n\n\nI present the Presidential Pulse Checker\nLatest probabilities: (BEST VIEWING ON DESKTOP.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI made my first real resume about 7ish years ago. I used the templates they have at BYU, my alma mater. They are simple, clean, and I love them to this day!\nHowever, I wanted a way to help streamline my resume. It was getting tedious fidgeting around in the original word doc, exporting as a pdf, and then updating in all the other places I kept it. Additionally, I wanted more control over my resume than Microsoft Word was giving me and a more programmatic approach. All of these thoughts led me to Posit’s relatively new Quarto. Quarto is a flexible platform that can generate scientific reports and publish in a variety of formats (you can actually make websites with it too). So, I decided to give it a spin.\n\n\nImplementation\nI knew that it would likely be more work up front to create the bare bones structure, but less work on the backend when I would just add a thing or two. And, my hope was that other people interested in this format could use it as well in a few minutes without all the upfront work.\nYou can render the document side-by-side as you are writing it up which I found very helpful in whatever program you use to edit it.\n\nYou can also render the pdf from the .qmd from the code below.\n#In the terminal where the .qmd file is kept, run below to generate pdf:\nquarto render resume_alex.qmd --to pdf\nTurned out because I was most interested in the pdf export, I ended up using mostly LaTeX and only some plain Markdown in my Quarto document. Though I haven’t experimented with exporting to html, I noticed that I wasn’t able to export to word when using custom LaTeX. My template can only be fully rendered in pdf form which is fine for my interests. But, for those interested in a Microsoft Word or html output, my template may not work for you.\nFinished product below… (also check out my cv tab on this website for the pdf; below is just a screenshot)\n\nHow did it turn out? Do you like my resume?\nOverall, I am happy how it turned out and happy to save some time. Feel free to clone/fork the repository where I have my resume for your personal use.\nIf you would like to clone the repo, copy the code below in the terminal. Then just update the files to have your resume information!\ngit clone https://github.com/acbass49/CV_Quarto.git\n\n\nTips if you try it\n\n\nI put comments throughout the .qmd document outlining where all the parts of the resume are, so should be able to update text and copy and paste sections as necessary.\n\n\nLike I mentioned above, most of this is built with LaTeX, so if you want to further customize, you will want to be googling how to do something in LaTeX. The only part that is in Markdown are the bulleted lists.\n\n\nI would recommend using RStudio as the tool for working with Quarto (same company built both), but as I use VScode a lot these days, I figured I would give Quarto’s VScode plug-in a try. Overall, I really liked the plug-in. Notably, you can render the .qmd document (as docx, pdf, html) in the window next to you which was very helpful. I believe this is the same for RStudio as well.\n\n\nAs a bonus, in the repository I have a shell script where you can see what actions I take to upload the new resume to my personal system and blog, and update the repositories.\n\n\nFeel free to message me with any questions"

    "title": "Myth of Latter-day Saint Prosperity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs a member of the LDS church, I have grown up hearing the claim although US Latter-day Saints make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the US general population. I assume this is a common misconception, given the amount of times I have heard it, as well as something I believed myself. At some point, I came across an article regarding Mormons in the US. I would just refer you to that article and you could be on your way, but the data is from 2009 - which is almost 15 years ago now! What a perfect opportunity for me to bake up some yummy data snacks regarding the breakdown of Latter-day Saints by household income and how it has changed over time.\n\n\nThe Snacks\nUsing data from a large political survey project of 500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021, I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6,452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a previous blog post I wrote up here if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this household income figure, we can answer our our first question! In 2021, the LDS actually has larger lower and middle classes and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth.\nI included Jews for the sake of including a group that actually is proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket than Latter-day Saints.\nNow lets look at how this trend has changed over the last 15 years…\nOur data source we used above is only for 2019-21, so we need to combine another source for this next graph. Pew Research Center publishes a religous landscape study that collects large sample sizes of most religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From this, we can look at 3 snapshots of LDS income over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt definitely looks like income is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. However, this doesn’t account for forces like inflation and how the overall US population has moved over the last 15 years. So let’s make another one, to see how income has changed compared to the general population\nSide note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracket has remained relatively stable over time. While we don’t have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle income bracket shrinks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking now at the Latter - day Saint group over time, the percentage of households making 100k+ consistently remains lower than the overall population. Also, it seems that the gap between the overall population and Latter - day Saints is growing over time. In 2007, there is a 6 point difference and goes from 6 to 8 to finally 11. Perhaps not only are Latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!\nLatter-day Saints are not a poor group overall (30% make 6-figures+!), this information just disputes the claim that Latter-Day Saints are proportionally wealthy.\n\n\nAppendix\nThe code that I used to analyze this data and create the graphs above are found on github. Please reach out with any questions or thoughts."

    "title": "County-Level Analysis of School Shootings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nTLDR : Learn a few facts about school shootings by looking at the figures/tables below.\nRecently, there has been a lot of talk about gun violence, school shootings, and various policy proposals (they actually just passed a law about this). People have opinions on all sides of these issues, but I wonder how many people understand key questions about the context of gun violence. Here are a few examples - specifically about school shootings which is the focus of this article:\n\n\nHow often does gun violence at school happen? Is the rate increasing or decreasing?\n\n\nAre gun violence incidents in schools concentrated in particular regions in America? If so, which?\n\n\nDo factors like living in a rich vs. poor area, predominantly white area, or other demographic factors change the likelihood of gun violence in schools?\n\n\nWhat effect, if any, do various gun laws already in-place have on school shootings?\n\n\nIn this post, I try to show the data behind a few of these questions in as non-partisan a way as possible.\n\n\nData\nAfter the Uvalde school shooting earlier this year, I saw a short article on USAFacts about school shootings. They made a figure visualizing trends from a rich dataset from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This dataset has a record of every school shooting in the last 50 years as well as interesting variables such as links to news articles, approximate number of shots fired, description of the event, and the school where it happened.\nFrom the city variable, I matched cities to counties and aggregated the shootings by county, so you could see how many school shootings were in each county in the US the last 50 years. From this point, I joined in several county-level datasets mostly from the census and a few other sources which have information like average income, percent educated at various levels, race, unemployment rate, laws, etc. all at the county level.\n\n\nLimitations\nFirst, it’s important to understand that school shootings in this dataset include…\n\n“all incidents in which a gun is brandished or fired or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims (including zero), time, day of the week, or reason (e.g., planned attack, accidental, domestic violence, gang-related).” - NCES\n\nThis opens up wiggle room because perhaps the incident wasn’t very severe (e.g. if there was only brandishing) and perhaps these account for a lot of the dataset. Turns out, as seen here (comparing fig2 and fig3 in this article) the majority of incidents result in at least one injury/deceased person. Also, for every record of school shootings, we have a description of the event which you can browse here if interested. I found when looking through that most of these cases seem like significant incidents. Besides, even in an incident where there was brandishing (threateningly waving a gun around) and no casualties, it would likely still be a impactful/scary incident for the child and parents. I also believe a similar thing for many accidental occurrences which could also be impactful/scary. For these reasons, I include all these cases in my analysis.\nNext, it is worth noting that because there are incidents that were perhaps never reported in some areas. This could lead to some bias especially if one region was significantly less likely to report incidents. However, in my mind, most areas should have a similar negative incentive to not report something like this because every school with a shooting looks bad whether in New Hampshire, South Carolina, or any other state.\nAlright now for our questions…\n\n\nHow often do school shootings happen? Is the rate increasing or decreasing?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we have simply the raw counts of all school shootings in the last 50 years. It’s pretty clear that the rate is increasing. Also, if you only look at deaths and injuries fig2 at this link, both of the trends - number of deaths and number of injuries from school shootings - seem to be increasing as well.\nTo give you a sense of how often these happen: if there are 130,000 schools in the US, and just over 250 shooting incidents this last year, your child’s school has about a 0.2% chance of seeing a shooting which is about 1 in 500. To put this in perspective, the odds of dying in a car crash is 1 in 114 and the odds of dying in a plane crash is 1 in 9,821 (according to this random website), so somewhere in between there i guess😂.\nThough I won’t spend any more time on this question now, fig 2 in this article details information about the shooters intent which I find interesting.\n\n\nAre gun violence incidents concentrated in particular regions in America? If so, which?\n\n\n\n\n\nJust from looking at the counts by region, gun incidents overall are more likely to occur in south - in a trend that has stayed consistent for the past 30 years. The gap between the south and the other regions seems to have grown wider in the past two years whereas before the south counts seemed only a little bit higher than the other regions.\nUsing my model, I generated predictions for all US counties below where we can see where the model predicts areas of higher concentration across the US. Hover to find the exact prediction for your county!\n\n\n\nGenerally, I feel the biggest take-away from the map above is that more populated counties are more likely to have school shootings which makes sense. For example, WY and the Dakotas have a low population and are not predicted to have many, but coastal areas such as CA are darker (meaning more predicted school shootings).\nBut, population isn’t the only factor, there does seem to be some hot spots, take Michigan and South Carolina for example. The map shows those two states seem darker in more areas than just their cities. These darker spots in less populated area are due to other factors that affect school shooting which we will talk a little more about in the next section.\n\n\nDo factors like living in a rich vs. poor area, predominantly white area, or other demographic factors change the likelihood of a school shooting?\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology note: For those interested, I estimated the model using Bayesian techniques (MCMC-style sampling in estimating the posterior distribution). I tested several models, but saw the best performance (best WAIC score) using a state-level random-intercepts negative-binomial regression. More info and code I used in github.\nHere is a table of selected features in my model (some are not included here for brevity’s sake). There are three easy ways to interpret this table: First, is it positive of negative? Positive numbers increase the number of school shootings while negative numbers decrease. Next, how big is the Mean relative to the others? With bigger numbers, the model estimates it has a bigger effect on school shootings and vice versa for smaller numbers. And, thirdly, Is the feature starred? We are more confident in the estimates of the starred features and not as confident in those that are not.\nSignificantly, the biggest starred feature is percent black in a county. The coefficient is high and it is starred. The direct interpretation of this model is we are around 2x as likely to see a shooting in counties as we increase 1 standard deviation in percent black in a county when controlling for the other features in the model. There is no effect for the other races.\nAnother interesting tidbit is what doesn’t seem to matter. In our model, all of the education variables (some are not included in this table) and the income variable do not have a star indicating there is no clear relationship - in essence, wealthy counties and educated counties seem to be just as likely to have school shootings than poor counties and non-educated counties. It is possible that this could not be true for counties that are both poor and uneducated, but I didn’t test this relationship specifically. Also, I don’t have a measure of income disparity here which could be significant. For example, a county that has a lot of really poor people and a lot of really rich people may have the same median income as a county with a lot of middle income people. I suspect this might be the case because we are confident counties with high unemployment rates are more likely to have school shootings (coefficient is positive and starred).\nOne last thing I’ll mention is that counties with more people are more likely to see school shootings, but these aren’t necessarily correlated to how urban/rural an area is. This is contrary to my prior belief about this.\n\n\nWhat effect, if any, do various gun laws (already in-place) have on school shootings?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom looking at the raw counts, while noisy, we can see that generally counties with state laws for universal background checks and gun permit laws see lower numbers for school shootings.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when controlling for other variables in our model, we are not confident that these laws have a positive effect on curbing gun violence in schools. For universal background checks, our model actually estimates a slight positive relationship, which could suggest that gun permit laws are more effective than background check laws at curbing violence in schools. This is also seen in the fivethirtyeight score - where there is no conclusive relationship between gun law strictness and state scores.\nMethodology note: Because of my model specification, I was only able to include a snapshot in time of state gun laws, so I included what the universal and gun permit laws were as of 2016; but, this data includes incidents from the past 50 years. I used a snapshot of gun laws with the assumption that states in the past 50 years with stricter laws generally continued to have stricter laws through the time period and vice versa. The object of this model and post is only to get a general overview and not a deep dive analysis on the effectiveness of gun laws, but perhaps I will do this in the future.\n\n\nConclusion\nMy personal takeaways from the analysis:\n\n\nThere seems to be evidence that gun violence is increasing in schools - especially in the last 3 years. Injuries, deaths, and non-fatal incidents have all increased.\n\n\nCounties with a 1 standard deviation of a higher black population are twice as likely to see school shootings. Whereas, rich counties and educated counties are just as likely as non-rich and non-educated counties to see school shootings.\n\n\nWe saw lower trends in shootings among states that had stricter gun laws when looking at the counts, but when we controlled for other variables, these effects went away. I noted, though, with our model we choose, it is good at getting a general overview of relationships, but a different model might be better at parsing out directly the effectiveness of these gun laws. So, I would say our findings here are overall inconclusive.\n\n\nHopefully, you’ve learned a thing or two at best to have more context into our gun control controversy and at worst to have something to keep the conversation going at dinner tonight (and keep it spicy because you would be discussing politics).\nFeel free to message me with questions about the methodology or anything else or comment below!

    "section": "",
    "text": "As some of you may know, my work is fairly political, so I have developed a habit of staying up to date on news and politics. Recently, social media has made some headlines including talks at congressional hearings, reporters expressing concern over its influence on elections, and some are worrying about censorship. So, amid all of this (and the rest of this post is a much lighter tone than this intro), I wanted to download my personal data from Facebook to show an overview of the role its played in my life since I got an account.\n\n👇Read This👇\nI made 4 figures from MY Facebook data. In my next project, I’m making a web app that lets YOU upload YOUR data and will generate these same figures for YOU. So, be thinking about what these figures would look like for YOUR data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWhew Ok. Lets see what’s going on here. Most clearly, my reactions spiked in 2020. My posts also inched up during that time. Wow, I guess the pandemic has increased my social media usage😬, but starting this blog last year probably contributed to this. Another thing, if you look closer, notice that there are no data points for 2015. In 2015, I was on my church service mission for the entire year and didn’t use social media! But, my friends spiked in 2016 accounting for the friends I made during that time and college freshman friends. Also, I moved twice in my 2019 college year and met a lot of people which explains the second friend bump. Hmm I wonder what YOUR graph would look like?👀👀\nNote: I aggregated the data by year. So, my 2021 data points are lower than the rest, but this may not be because I have used Facebook less during 2021, but rather there are many days left in this year that haven’t been accounted for.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWell the “Love” emoji is my most popular from the last year. When I made this graph originally using ALL of my data, I just got a bunch of “Like”s because that was the only reaction available for a long time; hence, I decided to filter the data to the last year only. Hmm perhaps I should try using the care/angry emojis.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Best Facebook Friends Wordlcloud\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, this is what we’re really here for. The bigger the name, the better friends my method thinks I am to that person. So for me, Austin Sebaske-Smith and Brandon Archer are my best FB friends, and turns out they are both worthy of that title🥺. If your name isn’t big or on the chart don’t worry, I still care about you too.\nHow I did this: I gave a certain amount of “friendship points” for each time you reacted to a person, mentioned a person in a comment, posted about a person, etc. Afterwards, I totaled these points for each friend. I then weighted by interaction(if I mentioned you in a post or comment, It could mean more than a simple reaction to a post) and recency.\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last chart was a fun add-on for me. Using a simple model, I processed all of my comments and posts and tried to determine which were positive and negative. Thankfully, a lot of my interactions were coded as positive😁. Though I think this is largely due to commenting for friend’s birthdays.\nHow I did this: there is a whole subsection of data science that is particularly focused on a computer understanding different sentiments in written text. It is called Natural Language Processing. This is fairly new field that has A LOT of room to grow. So there can be low accuracy and many errors. I used a dictionary that has words coded as positive and negative and I matched it my comments and posts for these scores.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\nNow my secrets are exposed - Oh well. Thanks for reading:) Shoot me a message or something if you would be interested in the app that generates these graphs for YOU. It might help me have more motivation to finish it.\nMy code for this post is here."

    "title": "7 Facts You May Not Know About Latter-Day Saints",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, I found myself reading a book by Jana Riess entitled The Next Mormons. It challenged some of my thoughts, and I generally found it interesting, so I wanted to share some thoughts here. Feel free to comment at the bottom of the page in the chat box and share your thoughts too (I just figured out how to add those to the bottom of my posts, so try it out!).\nThe premise of the book is describing findings from a survey of 1,156 Latter-day Saints and 540 former Latter-day Saints fielded September 8 - November 21, 2016 from an online panel (more methodology here if interested). I have shared data before from a more recent survey with Latter-day Saints, but this survey was unique because it was only a sample of Latter-day Saints and the survey questions were focused only on Latter-day Saints’ experiences and specifically Millennials (yeah I know… I found my niche truly as I am a survey-analyst, Millennial, Latter-day Saint). It reads very academic and summarizes both quantitative figures in charts and qualitative in-person interviews in the written text. Although the survey took place what is now almost 5 years ago, I find the content relevant and interesting now. So if the only church numbers you hear are from the Church Audit Report around General Conference time, you may be in the same place as I was.\n\n\nFact 1 : The percent of Latter-day Saints who have served missions has increased\n\n\n\n\n\nThis particular fact wasn’t extremely surprising to me - especially the fact that many more millennial women have served missions because of the age change. I think the reason I wanted to point this one out is that I didn’t realize that a higher percentage of members in general serve missions nowadays. Keep in mind that the Boomer/Silent generation number includes those who have joined later in life who did not have the opportunity to serve as a young missionary; however, the Boomer/Silent generation may also include those who served later in life which younger Latter-day saints have not had the opportunity to.\n\nFact 2 : There are generational divides on when it is ok to NOT wear garments\n\n\n\n\n\nTo me, this is interesting because Millennials are less likely than Boomer/Silents to have exceptions for wearing the garments except for “When ill or when there is a medical reason.” This makes enough sense as older groups would be more likely to be in situations where they are ill or when there is a medical reason where as for younger folks the situation may not have come up yet. Another interesting tidbit here is that 1/5 millennials excuse wearing garments when sleeping and on vacation when Boomer/Silents do not which I wasn’t necessarily expecting. I was expecting this behavior, but didn’t think there would be generational divides.\n\n\nFact 3 : Less than half of Millennial Latter-day Saints hold current temple recommends\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been portions of my life when I haven’t held a temple recommend, but I think my perception here was that most people had temple recommends. If anything, this was comforting to me knowing that not only do many people not have temple recommends currently, but many people have never held a temple recommend. I think I am impressed by the many people who continue to participate in the religion while not having access to the temple which is probably one of the coolest and most unique aspects of the religion. I honestly wish I had access to the data in this case just to see different breaks here. Are there any differences in gender, Utah/nonUtah, convert/grew up in the church?\n\n\nFact 4 : Having premarital sexual relations are just as likely regardless of age married\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile access to data for nation wide trends is much more readily available for sexual habits / activity (for example, the CDC collects a bunch of data on this if anyone is interested), it is not so much available for small subgroups like Latter-day Saints. This is especially interesting because premarital sexual experience is considered sinful by the LDS church which may discourage members from sharing these things with others which means that it probably is especially difficult to get a sense of how prevalent these behaviors are among members of the church. For me, this breakdown of premarital sexual experience is not necessarily surprising; however, it is surprising that those who are never married and those who are currently married have nearly the same percentage of people in each group. There is an exception for masturbation which is higher among the Latter-day Saints who have never married.\nLatter-day Saints may be cautious reporting these behaviors since they are against church standards, but it is also an anonymous internet-based survey which would eliminate the interviewer effect and create a more open environment for sharing with candidness.\n\n\nFact 5 : Many more millennial Latter-day saint mothers worked outside the home than Silent/Boomer Mothers\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was something that was surprising to me. While this trend is very clear in America - more American women work full-time now than ever before - it is also bleeding over into Latter-day Saint culture as well. More than 1/2 Millennial Latter-day saints grew up with a mother that worked. It would also be interesting to see whether more Latter-day Saint millennial parents were divorced than for other generations, but again, I am only limited to the data that is written about in the book. This is an interesting trend in Latter-day Saint culture and may suggest shifting in what a family means compared to what it was for Silent/Boomers.\n\n\nFact 6 : Many Latter-day Saints have not returned to the temple for the deceased after own work is done\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was also quite interesting to me. When I served my Latter-day Saint mission in Salt Lake City, Utah, I several people who never returned to the temple after receiving their endowments, but I wasn’t expecting more than 4 in 10 GenXers and Millennials not returning to the temple. Seeing that more Silent/Boomers have returned to the temple is not surprising as they both have more time to do it (being alive longer), may be retired with more time in the day, and I know many older Latter-day Saint folks who attend the temple regularly.\n\n\nFact 7 : General demographic profile of a former Latter-day Saint\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these things were not super interesting to me other than one group. It turns out that those who are less educated are more likely to leave the church. One prominent theory in political science literature is that as a society gets more educated, it will also become less religious and more secular. This trend is clearly seen in Europe, but the US has been interestingly resistant to this trend. And recently researchers are finding that college going Americans aren’t necessarily led away from religion. An opposite effect is also found in the Next Mormons Survey where college goers are more likely to stay active.\nThere were many more interesting facts in the book and I only included a small subset of things I found interesting here, so I would encourage you to check it out if you are interested in the changing landscape of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in America. She also just funded a kick starter campaign for funding for another survey focused on former Mormons and why they leave the church which will also be interesting.\nThanks for reading!

    "title": "Mobility in the COVID-19 Era: Urban vs. Rural",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn this unprecedented time, America and the world have experienced drastic changes in many aspects of modern day life. In an effort to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus, American leaders urged for precautionary measures such as closing non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and general social distancing protocol across the country.\nThe coronavirus has plagued our nation for several months now. In this post, I aim to answer two questions:\n\nHow did mobility of Americans change over time?\nDid urban and rural mobility trends differ?\n\nTo answer these questions, I needed to find relevant, trusted data sources. Luckily, @NateSilver538 tweeted a link and a few frequencies of this mobility from data posted by Apple’s Apple Maps. Apple claims that “reports are published daily and reflect requests in Apple Maps.” This source is great because because it shows mobility trends before and during COVID-19 taking hold in America; however, there are a few obvious limitations. First, many people do not use mapping services for local destinations, so people could still being going places, but simply do not use the mapping service to indicate where they go. This will still be effective for tourism and tech-reliant individuals. Secondly, many people do not use the apple mapping service, preferring Google or other services for their travel. While noting these limitations, I still think there are enough people using Apple Maps and putting directions into their phone to generally track mobility trends in state and counties over time.\nAs I thought about appropriate ways to measure how urban or rural a county was, I realized the complexity of the problem. Many counties are perhaps mostly urban and mostly rural, but still many exist that are difficult to label as one or the other. After a little research, I came across a very helpful resource put together by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). In 2013, they created their most recent classification system that divided counties into 6 groups based on their urbanization level. This would be a perfect resource for my purposes.\n\n\n\nHow Did Mobility of Americans Change Over Time?\nFor this first question, I created a figure to show the data. I looked at general mobility trends for each state from mid-January til the end of May. When I first plotted this data, I was surprised by all of the noise on the graph. It looked more or less like a cartogram measuring many heartbeats. I realized that Americans are more likely to enter navigations on certain days of the week, for weekends are more popular for traveling than Mondays and Tuesdays. So, for this reason, I decided to show the weekly mean of mobility to show clearer general trends. Additionally, each state starts at its own average mobility (set arbitrarily at 100) and any increase or decrease from that point is a percentage increase or decrease from that state’s average.\n(Technical note: all of the points on the graph do not start at 100 because the baseline is the sum of navigation requests for each area on January 23rd. Whereas, each point represents the weekly mean. So, lines with points starting higher than 100 on average had higher mobility requests after the first day.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows a slight increase near the end of February into March followed by a drastic decrease as shutdown for COVID-19 starts. It is clear that from mid-march to mid-April mobility trends in the US dipped drastically, but now many states’ mobility are returning back to normal.\nNote the overall variance of US states during February compared to the overall variance of US states at the end of May. There is much greater spread in the data at the end of May. This may signify that each state is in a different place in their recovery from COVID-19. Some states are lagging behind in their mobility while a few states even show significantly higher mobility rates even greater than pre-corona times; however, it seems the bulk of states have returned to almost-normal to normal mobility trends as of May 31st. Perhaps this is the case because more people like to travel in pleasant summer weather, or are ready to get out of the house after being cooped up.\n\n\n\nDid urban and rural mobility trends differ over time?\nTo answer this question, I created two figures: one to show different states and counties returning to normal, and the other to look specifically at urban, suburban, and rural counties. The map below shows an interactive heat map across time. This is great at showing mobility trends across various states (and counties). It also shows the drastic decrease in mobility beginning mid-March, and the return to normal.\n(Best viewing on Desktop; Press the play button for 😎)\n\n\nThe “white” color signifies average mobility while red shows higher mobility, and blue shows lower. Viewing the map over time, it seems to show states and counties with higher population dipping lower in mobility during the largest period of the COVID-19 shutdown, and also lagging behind others in returning to normal mobility at the end of May. While we may have a general idea which counties are truly urban, suburban, and rural, it can be hard to tell from the map.\nFor the last figure, I thought it would be more appropriate to look at county-level data as it is a smaller grouping geographically that can be more clearly defined as either urban, suburban, or rural. I incorporated the data from the NCHS to code various counties according to their individual level of urbanization, and then, I grouped the counties by rural, suburban, and urban.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these trends over time, it is what you might expect: rural counties maintain higher relative mobility across time. The gap between rural and urban widens toward the end of May with urban counties falling behind. Interestingly, many urban-classified areas seem to have returned to normal - though I expect urban counties in large cities like NYC to help in pulling down the urban average. The rural and suburban counties end well above their average in January which perhaps might suggest a trend where many people may want to move and travel after being living at home for a while.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile confounding variables exist such as some states have stay at home orders and other do not, this data shows a fairly good display of mobility trends overtime. Here is what we found from our analysis:\n\nMobility of Americans significantly decreased in March through April, but is beginning to return to normal for many states.\nEach state is returning to normal at its own rate with some states recovering much faster than others.\nRural and suburban counties have maintained higher mobility trends compared to urban counties with increasing disparity over time.\nMany states and counties have higher mobility ratings than pre-corona times which might be suggestive of a large wave of movement after Americans were kept inside with stay at home orders; however, it is important to note that mobility trends are general higher in the summer time anyway.\n\nMy coding is viewable here.\nThank you for looking through this post, and I hope you enjoyed it. I encourage you to share with others if you found it interesting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The genesis of this project came late night at a restaurant dinner in Charleston. I went out with my family to enjoy one of the delicious seafood locales common to the holy city. Going out with my family is always enjoyable with good conversation and lots of laughs. My parents enjoy taking our family out to eat now because my 4 siblings are mostly college-aged and can behave well in a public setting. However, my youngest brother, Micah, is 7 years old (significantly younger than the rest of my siblings) and isn’t as enticed by the adult conversation. Instead, he enjoys playing with toys or coloring when we go out.\nWhile we were enjoying the boiled peanuts and talking about the menu, Micah was happily trying to solve a word search puzzle on his kids’ menu. He seemed really engaged in finding all the words. He got stuck a few times, and I helped him find a few words, but he remained focused on it for a good portion of the night. Looking back, I know, for Micah, usually the kids’ menu activities don’t get his attention as much as just doodling with crayons does, so thats maybe why the word search puzzle stuck out to me that night. As I was helping him find a few words, I realized I could probably build a simple program to generate a bunch of these for him. He would at least enjoy the first few, right? So, this one’s for Micah.\nI built the web app below. Try it out! Put in a few words and make one for yourself!\n\n\n\n\nThe code I used to generate this puzzle is found here. I will probably write-up a post later detailing the steps I took to program this. Honestly, it was a lot of fun for me.\nIf you enjoyed the post, shoot me a message on social media or share it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis project started out as me trying to recreate a moving bar chart. I saw them around online and thought they were a cool way to visualize data over time that reminded me of a “data race.” Ironically, I came across a great site that stores car sales data over time, and thought it was the perfect fit to create a “race chart.” However, after I created my moving bar chart, I was still interested in learning more about car trends over time, and thought you might be as well. So, I decided to make some figures and write up a short piece.\nIn this post, I want to answer these two bullet-points:\n\nWhat have US car brand sales looked like since 1996?\nWhat is the top car brand now and since 1996 in the United States? What brands have sold more over time?\n\nNote: There is a reason I’m using 1996 as my starting point. The data I scraped is partially incomplete. There aren’t missing observations after the first data point, but some starting points are much later than when the brand begins selling cars. For example, the first recorded number of sales for Chevrolet in the dataset was in 1996 despite it being founded in 1911. The other brands seemed to begin and end at reasonable times according to my knowledge, and all brands seemed to have full data after 1996. Because of this, I decided to use 1996 as a starting point for the following figures. Even though it feels somewhat arbitrary, 23 years is still a sizable chunk of time to view car sales.\n\n\n\nWhat have car brand sales looked like in the past 23 years?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a few notable trends since 1996. Firstly, the United States experienced an economic recession around 2008–09 which clearly affected car sales. Almost every brand dropped in sales at that time and some of the big brands never fully recovered even in 2019 - almost a decade later. With an initial look, it might appear that the car industry has sold fewer units over time. But, if you look at the aggregated yearly car sales (below), you can see that people are buying just as many cars in 2019 as they were before the recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what does this mean? This means that more of the market share of car sales is distributed among more brands today than in the past. Hopefully, this is positive news as it may suggest that the market is more competitive with more companies having more power in the car sales market.\nOne could argue that we are actually selling less cars because there are more people in America in 2019 as compared to 1996, and so the car sales per capita is lower. The figure above does not control for confounding variables like this, but only looks at the raw car sales number over time. I mention this because when viewing any figure it is always important to keep possible confounding variables in mind. However, in this case, I still think that car sales data has an interesting story to tell and can be particularly valuable in making relative comparisons. With these relative comparisons (comparing Ford to Toyota etc.), the population confounding variable is controlled for as the US population differences between ’96 and 2019 shift the same amount for both US brands. Using a comparison, you just see one brand simply out-performing another because it holds time variables, like change in overall US population, constant.\n\n\n\nWhat is the top car brand now and over the last 20 years in the United States? What brands have sold more over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from the race graph in the beginning, Ford has consistently sold more units than any other brand in the past 25 years. This figure shows the total sales of each of the brands from 1996-2019 with Ford in the lead. While it is easy to see who sold the most cars with a graph like this over a period of time, you cannot see how the individual businesses trended over that time period. Perhaps one brand steadily grew, while another sold a lot of cars at first, but then went bankrupt. So, we still don’t know which brands have truly grown and done better over time. To help answer this question, I created two more figures. The first shows a brand’s increase or decrease in market share, and the second shows a relative comparison of sales growth over the time period. Both figures show a different aspect of brand growth.\nTechnical note: This figure does not control for whether the total number of car sales is increasing or decreasing. Normally, it might be wise to put these on a scale showing the percent of the market share they each took, but since the total market share is relatively close to the same over time (as seen in figure 3), and the market in general has been quite dynamic, I believe you can see the trends by just subtracting the first and last year.\nIn the figure above, we can see at the top of the list: Nissan, Toyota, and Honda. All of these brands now take significantly more of the market share in 2019 as compared to 1996. This means that their business has increased over time and has made positive absolute change. But, we may also want to know which companies have actually grown significantly in size. This would give us a better picture of which companies have really taken off. (If you think about it, a huge monopoly can increase in sales 1% which increase might mean a higher number of sales than everyone else because that 1% means a lot of cars, but the huge monopoly isn’t really experiencing growth.) The figure below specifically shows which companies relatively have increased in size since 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\nKia, Nissan, and Tesla are the top three brands that have seen the highest percentage increases from 1996 to 2019. While percentage change can be helpful, it can often be misleading. For example, if a person A sells 1 car the first year and then 10 cars the next year they are performing at 1000% compared to their previous year while person B sold 1 million cars the first year and will have to sell significantly more than 10 cars to get their percentages to match person A. Person B might be dominating the market, but if you only looked at percentage increases you may never know.\nThese two figures become particularly useful if brands appear on the top of both (which some do!). For those brands, it means that they are both selling a significantly higher portion of the market share and have significantly increased in size compared with the starting year which, in this case, points to Nissan, Hyundai, and Subaru.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAs we have looked through the data, we have found a few insights about the car sales market since 1996:\n\nFord has consistently sold more cars any other brand since 1996 and remains in the lead in 2019.\nThe US recession in 2008-09 had a large impact on the car sales market decreasing yearly car sales as much as 7 million overall, but has recovered since that time.\nPartially because of the recession, today, more brands have more of the market share than in 1996.\nA few brands have seen substantial growth during the last 23 years and now hold a significant portion of the market share. These brands include Nissan, Subaru, and Hyundai.\n\nMy coding is viewable here. I modeled my race chart off of this post.\nThank you for looking through this post, and I hope you enjoyed it. Feel free to comment below, and I encourage you to share with others if you found it interesting. For my next project, I want to look at car companies over time and how they relate to car brands… so stay tuned!"

    "title": "Latter-Day Saints: Growing Pains In The GOP",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBetween Mitt Romney’s nomination in 2012 and present times, the Republican Party has seen shifts in make-up and goals. In 2016, Trump tapped into a somewhat different base than previous Republicans - appealing strongly to non-college whites. Policy-wise, Trump has been more aggressive with border-controls, pushing domestic production, and tougher on some foreign players like China. But, while some groups have been more supportive of the evolving GOP platform, others have drifted further from it.\nLatter-day Saints (Mormons) are perhaps a good example of this. In Utah’s 2016 presidential vote cast, Evan McMullin - a third-party candidate - won more than 1/5 of Utah’s ballots. Even in the 2020 election, while many more Utahns supported Trump than in 2016, Trump only garnered 58% of the votes (compared to Romney’s 73% in 2012).\nIn this post, I am interested in diving further into Latter-day Saint political trends and learning of possible pressure points for them in the new GOP.\n\n\n\nData\nThe Democracy Fund and UCLA released data from one of the largest public opinion surveys ever conducted including 156,000 cases collected from July 2019–July 2020. More info on this here. After combining these surveys, I was able to get a large Latter-day Saint sample of n=3787.\n\n\n\nSo… What did I find?\nLet’s first take a look at a few summary statistics to see how Latter-day Saints break out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike previous studies have found, Latter-day Saints are a much more Republican group when compared to the United States in general; however, 1 in 4 Latter-day Saints identify or lean Democrat.\n(Side note: In these figures, Republicans and Democrats include those who identify with the Republican/Democrat Party AND those who initially identify as Independent, but then say they vote/lean more Republican than Democrat or vice versa. This may seem like a confusing practice, but it is common for data to be reported this way because some scholars find Independent leaners behave almost indistinguishably from regular partisans. Typically, when others visualize party break data, they will specify whether leaners are included.)\nSo, what does this look like over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this figure, we can see more Latter-day Saints identified and leaned Republican in 2014 than in both 2007 and 2019-20. This isn’t too surprising as the Republican nominee in 2012 was Mitt Romney, a Latter-day Saint. But, as we hypothesized, the number of Republican Latter-day Saints in 2019-20 has not only dropped lower than 2014, but also perhaps lower than it was previously in 2007. Also, more Latter-day Saints are identifying as Democrats (+6 from 2014).\nI would have included more snapshots of Latter-day Saint party identification over time, but because they only make up ~1.5% of the population, it can be hard to find data with sufficient sample sizes to make inferences about their population. Thankfully, Pew Research Center every so often puts out the “Religious Landscape Study” with a large enough sample to study smaller religious groups. I used this study to fill in the 2007 and 2014 data points in the figure above.\n\n\n\nWhy Are We Seeing A Decrease In Latter-day Saint Republicans?\nIn the Nationscape Survey, respondents were asked a series of policy questions from healthcare, to economics, to legalization of marijuana. Seeing how Latter-day Saints respond to these questions may give us some insight as to why we are seeing some Latter-day Saints leave the Republican Party.\nShown below are the issues where Latter-day Saints had the largest percentage point differences from Republicans in the Democratic direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, all of these issues are related. Four of the five policies are about immigration, and all of them have been supported by Trump (or were actions he took). The biggest point difference between Republicans and Latter-day Saints - building the Mexico wall - was a central focus in Trump’s 2016 campaign platform and something he pushed throughout his presidency. In this, we see Latter-day Saints showing resistance to key Trump policies and actions with foreign players (as seen in many disagreeing on imposing tariffs on China) which suggests some distaste for Trump.\nLatter-day Saints also noticeably lean left on immigration issues. As it turns out, our immigration finding is nothing new. Others have noted this and especially among Latter-day Saints who served foreign church service missions (usually 1.5-2 years in duration). But, to me, the main takeaway from this figure is Latter-day Saints reveal at least one way why they are hesitant toward Trump: his stance on immigration.\nWe also may see distaste for Trump in this impeachment question.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 1 in 4 Latter-day Saints agreed with this compared to almost 3 in 4 Democrats. However, even though Latter-day Saints are much closer to Republicans than Democrats on impeaching Trump, Latter-day Saints actually are almost twice as far from Republicans on this issue as they are on average(more on averages in the next section). In that, we see more evidence of some Latter-day Saint hesitancy toward Trump.\n\n\n\nSo Why Do Latter-day Saints Stick Around With The GOP?\nIt is important to note that while the figure above shows the largest point deviations from Republicans, Latter-day Saints still don’t match Democrat levels of agreement on ANY issue analyzed in this survey (though some issues Latter-day Saints are fairly close to Democrats like “imposing tariffs on china”). Most of the time, Latter-day Saints are closely aligned with Republican agreement levels, and sometimes they agree more in the Republican direction on issues than Republicans themselves. A full list of policies questions and agree percentages is found here.\nI created a below table describing the average difference between each group’s responses to the various policy questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Republicans and Latter-days Saints are a lot closer together than Democrats and Latter-day Saints on average policy agreement levels. In fact, on average Latter-day Saints and Democrats are almost as far apart as Republicans and Democrats.\nLet’s dive more into what these numbers mean. Among the policy questions that were asked, for example, “Should we raise taxes on families making over $600,000?” If 40% of Republicans agreed with this statement, Latter-day Saints agreeing would on average fall 6 points apart of 40%, so perhaps Latter-day Saints would report 46% agreeing. And Democrats would fall at 26 points away on average, so perhaps 66% of Democrats agree. This just shows that policy-wise Latter-day Saints were significantly closer to Republicans than Democrats on average. The actual numbers for this question are 76% of Democrats, 51% of Republicans, and 49% of Latter-days Saints agree.\nOn most all other issues - healthcare, size of government, family values - Latter-day Saints are closely aligned to the Republican Party.\nBut enough on this.\n\n\n\nWhat Issues Exactly Do Latter-day Saints Lean the Furthest Right?\nAnother reason Latter-day Saints stick around is shown in the next figure. Below are the issues where Latter-day Saints leaned the furthest RIGHT by percentage point. These could represent the conservative positions Latter-day Saints cling to most strongly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI belieive Latter-day Saints stick around because some church teachings are closely aligned with conservative policy positions.\nFor example, it is a commandment for Latter-day Saints not to use marijuana recreationally. The Latter-day Saint prophet has also taught abortion to be wrong except in special cases (rape, incest, and mother’s life). Some teachings - like these - are directly aligned with conservative positions on social freedoms.\n\n\n\nWrap Up\nThat last bit helped convince me that not only are Latter-day Saints sticking around right now, but also I don’t anticipate any large movements of Latter-day Saints to the Democratic Party in near future. I say this because while there are evidences of Latter-day Saint growing pains in the Republican Party with Trump and new stances on immigration, these simply won’t overpower the long tradition of Latter-day Saint voting patterns. The church itself doesn’t choose sides, but Latter-day Saints have traditionally voted for policies that restrict social freedoms to boundaries consistent with church teachings.\nHowever unlikely, I think it is possible that this tradition changes. I could potentially see a world where Latter-day Saints applied prophetic teachings in their personal lives, and voted for many socially liberal policies as the GOP continued to hit more pressure points and elect more Trumps. I don’t think this will happen, but I do believe that the evolving GOP platform has got at least a few Latter-day Saints thinking about some of this.\nThanks for reading! Would love to hear your thoughts about my work. Also, please feel free to share with others if you found it interesting 😀\n\n\n\nAppendix\nMy table I referenced in the article is here.
