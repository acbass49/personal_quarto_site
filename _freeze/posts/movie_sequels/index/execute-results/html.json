When I was younger, it seemed movies were more of a one-off thing. Now, it feels like almost every movie has a sequel and sometimes many more. Lets look at some data to see what's going on here. For this analysis, I write down a series of questions and answer them one-by-one. Scroll down to see the questions ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n## Previous Studies\n\nI started this analysis by looking at what others had done with movie sequels. I found loads of data movie analyses, but few about movie sequels. Here are a few of the links I found: \n\n- I found a [kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/orimeidler/are-sequel-movies-really-worse) looking at this question, and I followed a similar data preparation process (without using French Wikipedia). He looks at one question (Are movie sequels less quality) whereas I look across a series of questions.  \n- [This one](https://stephenfollows.com/hollywood-sequels-by-the-numbers/) give a good overview of some of the assumptions that go into this type of analysis. For example, \"how is a series defined?\" and \"What do we do with series that have changed significantly over time?\"  \n- [This one](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10/movie-sequels-better-data-science.html#comments) looks interesting, but several of the figures wouldn't render on my device which referenced the company silk.co. I am skeptical that this website/company still exists.  \n\n## Data\n\nFor the data, I used [a list created on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003495084/) containing around 1200 movies and sequels. It is not an exhaustive list, but it covers a lot of ground. Unfortunately, this list was missing a few things I wanted such as the movie's revenue, budget, language, production company, and other variables. I joined these in via the [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). The data is available for download on the link to the side.\n\nIn the first chart, I also join in a non-commercial dataset from IMDB which can be accessed [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com).\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nThe data from TMDB is community based - meaning people self-report the revenue and some of the other data. Unfortunately, this means that there may be errors at times in the data. There are state-of-the-art data and APIs available, but only through paywalls and I'm not paying üòÇ\n:::\n\n## Questions\n\n\n#### Are There More Sequels Over Time?\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nUpon manual inspection of the data, I noticed that the list did not include a lot of movie sequels after 2010 eventhough some exist. For example, my data includes the first 5 Tinker Bell Movies up until 2012, but does not include movies 6-8. [Yes, there are 8 Tinker Bell moviesüòÇ](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls063298470/). So, I would interpret the decrease in sequels after 2012 with caution.\n:::\n\n::: {#012146ce .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=662 height=518}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Main Takeaway:** It seems there was a spike in sequels after the year 2000. And, the spike in sequels may have come a little bit before the spike in movies, but, generally, sequel production has followed the movie production trend overall and **increased over time**.\n\n#### Do Sequels Make More Than The Original?\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nI noticed that several movie revenues were missing, so I went through each missing value and looked up the revenue [here](https://www.the-numbers.com) which is the recommended resource for TMDB contributors (read more in the [TMDB Bible](https://www.themoviedb.org/bible/movie/59f3b16d9251414f20000001#59f73b759251416e71000007)). Originally, there were some significant movies that showed $0 such as Avatar (the blue people version), one of the best performing films ever. I added in all the latest numbers in the data that can be downloaded on the right.\n\nThese number *are* inflation adjusted using the CPI.\n\nBelow, I define \"About the same\" when the revenue of the sequel is the same as the original within a 10% margin (+/- 5%)\n:::\n\n::: {#18cf2135 .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=589 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at a simple crosstab breakout above, we see that the original movie is likely to make more money than the sequel more than 60% of the time.\n\n::: {#ee0cd9c9 .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){width=585 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, if you look at the distributions between the original and the sequel, they look quite similar. There is an exception though: sequels are much more likely to make zero dollars.\n\n**Main Takeaway:** More than 60% of the time, the original outperforms the sequel. If the sequel makes revenue, the sequel may perform similarly to the original in revenue.\n\n#### Are Sequels Rated Higher Than The Original?\n\n::: {#7b631cd2 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=585 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe IMDB distributions for these are fairly gaussian bell-curve looking. As you can see, the Original is on average rated higher with a median rating of 6.9 whereas the sequel is on averate rated lower with a median of 6.1.\n\nWe are just looking at the overall distributions here, but we can calculate the actual average difference in score which I do below.\n\n::: {#7bf00b0f .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef imdb_diff(data_part):\n  tmp = data_part.sort_values(\"sequel_num\").reset_index(drop=True)\n  return tmp.loc[0,\"IMDb Rating\"] - tmp.loc[1,\"IMDb Rating\"]\n\ndiff = data.query(\"sequel_num in [1,2]\") \\\n  .groupby(\"sequel_group\") \\\n  .apply(imdb_diff) \\\n  .mean()\n\ndiff = round(diff,2)\n\nprint(f\"On average, the original is rated {diff} points higher than its sequel\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOn average, the original is rated 0.77 points higher than its sequel\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Are Sequels More Popular Than The Original?\n\n::: {#3d972c49 .cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-8-output-1.png){width=585 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDiscuss Popularity Score. On TMDB. link is [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/popularity-and-trending).\n\n#### Do Sequels Typically Recieve Less Budget?\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThese number *are* inflation adjusted using the CPI.\n:::\n\n::: {#cb613a76 .cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.png){width=576 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Takeaway:** Lower numbers of sequels are more common (you can see the N-size decrease as the sequel number increases), but the trend is clear; sequels on average recieve a higher budget.\n\n#### Which are the most popular production companies for making sequels?\n\n#### What Predicts The Success of Films (Revenue, IMDB)?\n\n#### FEATURE: How Does Time Between a Film and Its Sequel Affect Its Success?\n\n#### FEATURE: More Budget Bettr Movie?\n\n#### FEAUTRE: Are Sequels Who Keep The Same Director More Or Less Successful?\n\n## Questions for Future Study\n\nPerhaps look into [collections](https://www.themoviedb.org/bible/collection#5a0b1dee9251416561000009)\n\n",
