The more I look into searches, the more I'm impressed by the interesting and vast amount of data avaiable.\n\nFor example, i recently learned that Google Trends is quite effective in predicting large elections [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764220975067) and [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/11/143). I even went through the exercise of looking myself at the last 5 US elections. Excluding the 2020 election, the winning candidate had more search volume months leading up to the elections. The trend did not hold for Trump's last election, but maybe we chalk that up to Trump being a peculiar candidate or 2020 being a peculiar year. I may decide to do an analysis on this later.\n\n## Honing in on the GOP Primary Nomination\n\nMy thought was that if Google Trends can be effective for US Presidential Elections, what about Primaries?\n\nFor this I wanted to make a stream chart to display these results for two reasons:\n1. You can see the relative importance each candidate has to one another given by vertical distance of each color at a given point in time.\n2. You also get a sense of the total search volume of all candidates given by the vertical distance of all colors at a given point in time.\nI plan to keep this chart updated up until the primary election. I guess we'll see how accurate it is in the end ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThis graph was last updated: 01 Jul 2023 21:25:29\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Google Trends Data From January of the Top Candidates for the Republican Party. ](index_files/figure-html/fig-primary-1.png){#fig-primary width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Observation 1\n#### Observation 2\n#### Observation 3\n\n## Comparing aggregator to Google trends\n\nAs a bit of validation, aside from spikes in the google trends data (likely due to Trump court shenanigans), it is similar to the 538 polling aggregator. For instance, if you rescale the side bar chart numbers to 100, Trump has 55% of the hits, DeSantis has 25%, Nikki Haley has 10% and the others have 5%.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3349_RC01/embed_loader.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntrends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"Donald Trump\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2023-02-01 2023-07-01\"},{\"keyword\":\"Ron DeSantis\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2023-02-01 2023-07-01\"},{\"keyword\":\"Mike Pence\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2023-02-01 2023-07-01\"},{\"keyword\":\"Nikki Haley\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2023-02-01 2023-07-01\"},{\"keyword\":\"Tim Scott\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2023-02-01 2023-07-01\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=2023-02-01%202023-07-01&geo=US&q=Donald%20Trump,Ron%20DeSantis,Mike%20Pence,Nikki%20Haley,Tim%20Scott&hl=en\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"});\n</script>\n\n\n![](/./about_files/primary2.png)\n\nFor one of my next project before the election, I am planning on building an election model and from my analysis with this google trends data, I am convinced that it could be a useful predictor of an election result in a model.\n\nFeel free to leave share comments/thoughts below üôÇ\n\n<div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\n<script>\n    /**\n    *  RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT AND UNCOMMENT THE SECTION BELOW TO INSERT DYNAMIC VALUES FROM YOUR PLATFORM OR CMS.\n    *  LEARN WHY DEFINING THESE VARIABLES IS IMPORTANT: https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/#configuration-variables    */\n    var disqus_config = function () {\n    this.page.url = 'https://alexbass.me/posts/primary_stream/';  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable\n    this.page.identifier = 'primary_stream'; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable\n    };\n    (function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE\n    var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');\n    s.src = 'https://alexbassc.disqus.com/embed.js';\n    s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());\n    (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);\n    })();\n</script>\n<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>\n\n<script id=\"dsq-count-scr\" src=\"//alexbassc.disqus.com/count.js\" async></script>\n",
