This post is work in progress. Just writing down some preliminary thoughts.

This post is mainly geared toward my Latter - day Saint peers because I think, collectively, we have some misconceptions about what the demographics of the LDS church (within the United States) are. Though I don't have data to back this claim up per say that other people in fact think this, I often hear when speaking with others the claim that although members of the church make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the general population. More or less, I simply thought this was false after a Pew Research article I read awhile back which I did [find here](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/07/24/a-portrait-of-mormons-in-the-us/).

Using data from Pew's Religious Landscape study, I looked at the demographics of the LDS and Jewish Population, and I am comparing this with the American Community Survey estimates of the general population. Keep in mind: for this first figure, I used data from 2014 which is now *almost 10 years* ago (yikes that's my high school graduation year). Probably not THAT much has changed in 10 years, but there probably have been some shifts.

From this preliminary figure, we can see that (and some of this also noted in the Pew article above) that the LDS actually has a larger middle class than the rest of the population and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket. In the data I have above, It also shows that the LDS has a higher proportion of low income individuals as well as compared to the general population...

This is what 2014 data looks like, but what about 2021 data? [after analysis, insert this part here]

Eventual goals of the study...
1. Historic data
2. With recent data (nationscape), are LDS more or less likely to be in the upper income brackets?
3. How was this changed over time? (how do I break this up)
