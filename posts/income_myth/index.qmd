### Introduction

This post is mainly geared toward my Latter - day Saint peers because I think, collectively, we have some misconceptions about what the demographics of the LDS church are within the United States. Though I don't have data to back this claim up per say that other LDS people in fact think this, I often hear when speaking with others the claim that **although members of the church make up only a small percentage of the population, we are disproportionally wealthy when compared to the general population**. After hearing this claim again yesterday, since I've thought this was false, I decided now to look at some data describing this claim. I believe my opinion changed on this awhile back when I read a Pew Research article that provided a demographic profile of Mormons in the US. If anyone is interested in the original article I read, I did find it [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/07/24/a-portrait-of-mormons-in-the-us/).

### The Meat

Using data from a large political survey project of [500,000 Interviews from 2019-2021](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/nationscape), I was able to filter the sample to only Latter-day Saint respondents and ended up with a sample 6452 members found across the United States. I used the same data source as a [previous blog post](/./posts/lds_gop) I wrote up, but have more data this time since the third survey fielding wave was completed after I wrote it.

From this figure, we can see that (and some of this also noted in the Pew article above) that the LDS actually has a larger lower and middle class and has a smaller proportion of people in the highest income bracket than the rest of the population. Hopefully, this is enough to convince you that Latter-day Saints being proportionally wealthier is a myth. 

I included Jews for the sake of including a group that *actually is* proportionally wealthy, and the gap is large. According to our data, the Jews are *more than twice as likely to be in the top income bracket* than Latter-day Saints.

Our last figure showed a snapshot of LDS wealth in 2019-2021, but how has this looked over the last 15 years? Are Latter-day Saints getting wealthier over time or perhaps the other way around?

Aside from Nationscape, Pew Research Center publishes a [religous landscape study](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/) that collects large(ish) sample sizes of many religious groups in the United States. For Latter-day Saints, there is a sample of around 500 for this study which was fielded in 2007 and 2014. From these we can create look at LDS wealth over the last 15 years in increments of 7 years.

From the second figure, it definitely looks like wealth is increasing over time among Latter-day Saints. In the 100k+ group, we see 16% to 20% then 29%. But when viewing this graph, we should keep in mind that we don't account for how money and income have changed over the last 15 years. The dollar has gotten more inflated and so by income percentile LDS may not have moved at all compared to the rest of the US. We would need to see a figure with the US overall numbers plotted over time to be sure. Well as it turns out - I am the graph man, so I'll just make another one.

One other note about the above figure: I find it interesting that the proportion of LDS people in the lowest income bracked has remained relatively stable over time. While we don't have the data we need to safely make this claim, our graph could suggest that there is a slight income disparity growing within the church as the middle shrinks over time.

In our last figure, we see a different story from our previous graph. Jews, our proportionally prosperous group, are soaring above the overall population as share whose household income is 100k+. Over time, Latter - day Saints have consistently remained below the overall population in household income - at least in the last 15 years. Also, it seems that this gap is growing over time between the overall population and Latter - day Saints. In 2007 on our graph, there is a 6 point difference between the Overall population and Latter-day Saints which seems to grow over time from 6 to 8 to finally 11. From our third graph, it might suggest that not only are latter-day saints below the average, but may even be getting poorer over time!
