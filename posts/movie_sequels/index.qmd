## Introduction

I've wanted to do this post for a while now. When I was younger, it seemed movies were more of a one-off thing. Now, it feels like almost every movie has a sequel and sometimes many more. Lets look at some data to see what's going on here. For this analysis, I write down a series of questions and answer them one-by-one. Scroll down to see the questions ⬇️

## Previous Studies

I started this analysis by looking at what others had done with movie sequels. I found loads of data movie analyses, but few about movie sequels. Here are a few of the links I found: 

- I found a [kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/orimeidler/are-sequel-movies-really-worse) looking at this question, and I followed a similar data preparation process (without using French Wikipedia). He looks at one question (Are movie sequels less quality) whereas I look across a series of questions.  
- [This one](https://stephenfollows.com/hollywood-sequels-by-the-numbers/) give a good overview of some of the assumptions that go into this type of analysis. For example, "how is a series defined?" and "What do we do with series that have changed significantly over time?"  
- [This one](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10/movie-sequels-better-data-science.html#comments) looks interesting, but several of the figures wouldn't render on my device which referenced the company silk.co. I am skeptical that this website/company still exists.  

## Data

For the data, I used [a list created on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003495084/) containing around 1200 movies and sequels. It is not an exhaustive list, but it covers a lot of ground. Unfortunately, this list was missing a few things I wanted such as the movie's revenue, budget, language, production company, and other variables. I joined these in via the [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). The data is available for download on the link to the side.

In the first chart, I also join in a non-commercial dataset from IMDB which can be accessed [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com).

:::{.callout-warning}
The data from TMDB is community based - meaning people self-report the revenue and some of the other data. Unfortunately, this means that there may be errors at times in the data. There are state-of-the-art data and APIs available, but only through paywalls and I'm not paying 😂

## Questions

```{python}
# | include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#import my data
data = pd.read_excel("./cleaned_data_w_rev.xlsx")
```

#### Are There More Sequels Over Time?

:::{.callout-warning}
Upon manual inspection of the data, I noticed that the list did not include a lot of movie sequels after 2010 eventhough some exist. For example, my data includes the first 5 Tinker Bell Movies up until 2012, but does not include movies 6-8. [Yes, there are 8 Tinker Bell movies😂](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls063298470/). So, I would interpret the decrease in sequels after 2012 with caution.
:::

```{python}
# | echo: false
# filter to sequels only
to_join = pd.read_csv("./to_join.csv")
sequels = data.query("sequel_num >= 2")

# Scatter plot X: Time, Y: Count
y = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].to_list()
x = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].index.to_list()

#Joining in all movies
sequels = pd.DataFrame({"Num_sequels":y,"Year":x})
sequels = sequels.merge(to_join, on="Year", how="left")
y2 = sequels["Movie_num"]

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

color = '#342bbb'
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Sequel Count', color=color)
ax1.plot(x, y, color=color)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()  # instantiate a second axes that shares the same x-axis

color = '#BB3E18'
ax2.set_ylabel('Movie Count', color=color)  # we already handled the x-label with ax1
ax2.plot(x, y2, color=color)
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

fig.tight_layout()  # otherwise the right y-label is slightly clipped
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)

plt.title("Sequels Spiked Around 2010")
plt.show()
```

**Main Takeaway:** It seems there was a spike in sequels after the year 2000. And, the spike in sequels may have come a little bit before the spike in movies, but, generally, sequel production has followed the movie production trend overall and **increased over time**.

#### Do Sequels Make More Than The Original?

:::{.callout-note}
I noticed that several movie revenues were missing, so I went through each missing value and looked up the revenue [here](https://www.the-numbers.com) which is the recommended resource for TMDB contributors (read more in the [TMDB Bible](https://www.themoviedb.org/bible/movie/59f3b16d9251414f20000001#59f73b759251416e71000007)). Originally, there were some significant movies that showed $0 such as Avatar (the blue people version), one of the best performing films ever. I added in all the latest numbers in the data that can be downloaded on the right.

These number *are* inflation adjusted using the CPI.

Below, I define "About the same" when the revenue of the sequel is the same as the original within a 10% margin (+/- 5%)
:::

```{python}
# | echo: false

def seq_diff(data_part):
  tmp = data_part.sort_values("sequel_num").reset_index(drop=True)
  val = tmp.loc[0,"adjusted_rev"] - tmp.loc[1,"adjusted_rev"]
  within_5 = np.multiply(np.divide(tmp.loc[0,"adjusted_rev"],100),5)
  if val > within_5:
    r_val = "original made more"
  elif val < -within_5:
    r_val = "sequel made more"
  else:
    r_val = "about the same"
  return r_val

fig3_data = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2]") \
  .groupby("sequel_group") \
  .apply(seq_diff)

cat_type = pd.api.types.CategoricalDtype(categories=["sequel made more", "about the same", "original made more"], ordered=True)

fig3_data = fig3_data.astype(cat_type)

p = sns.histplot(x=fig3_data, stat="proportion", shrink=.8, color='#251e83')#'#688311',
plt.title("More Than 60% of the Time, The Original Made More \$\$")
plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

Looking at a simple crosstab breakout above, we see that the original movie is likely to make more money than the sequel more than 60% of the time.

```{python}
# | echo: false
fig2_data = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2]") \
  .assign(log_of_revenue = lambda x:np.log(x.adjusted_rev+1))

p = sns.histplot(data=fig2_data, x="log_of_revenue", hue="sequel_num", element="step", palette = ['#688311', '#251e83'])
sns.move_legend(p, "upper right", title='Movies', frameon=False)
plt.title("Bimodal Distrbution at \$0 and e^19 ≈ \$180 Million")
plt.ylabel("Movie Count")
plt.xlabel("Log of Revenue")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

However, if you look at the distributions between the original and the sequel, they look quite similar. There is an exception though: sequels are much more likely to make zero dollars.

**Main Takeaway:** More than 60% of the time, the original outperforms the sequel. If the sequel makes revenue, the sequel may perform similarly to the original in revenue.

#### Are Sequels Rated Higher Than The Original?

```{python}
# | echo: false
fig_data = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2]") \
  .assign(log_of_revenue = lambda x:np.log(x.revenue+1))

p = sns.histplot(data=fig_data, x="IMDb Rating", hue="sequel_num", element="step", palette = ['#688311', '#251e83'])

og_med = fig_data.query("sequel_num == 1")["IMDb Rating"].median()

p.axvline(og_med, color='#688311', lw=4)

p.text(x=7.2, y=60, s=f'Original Median:\n{og_med}', color='#688311')

sql_med = fig_data.query("sequel_num == 2")["IMDb Rating"].median()

p.axvline(sql_med, color='#251e83', lw=4)

p.text(x=5.9, y=53, s=f'Sequel Median:\n{sql_med}', color='#251e83',
horizontalalignment = "right")

sns.move_legend(p, "upper left", title='Movies', frameon=False)
plt.title("On Average, Originals Have Higher Ratings")
plt.ylabel("Movie Count")
plt.xlabel("IMDB Score")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

The IMDB distributions for these are fairly gaussian bell-curve looking. As you can see, the Original is on average rated higher with a median rating of 6.9 whereas the sequel is on averate rated lower with a median of 6.1.

We are just looking at the overall distributions here, but we can calculate the actual average difference in score which I do below.

```{python}
def imdb_diff(data_part):
  tmp = data_part.sort_values("sequel_num").reset_index(drop=True)
  return tmp.loc[0,"IMDb Rating"] - tmp.loc[1,"IMDb Rating"]

diff = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2]") \
  .groupby("sequel_group") \
  .apply(imdb_diff) \
  .mean()

diff = round(diff,2)

print(f"On average, the original is rated {diff} points higher than its sequel")
```

#### Are Sequels More Popular Than The Original?

```{python}
# | echo: false
fig2_data = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2]") \
  .assign(log_of_popularity = lambda x:np.log(x.popularity+1))

p = sns.histplot(data=fig2_data, x="log_of_popularity", hue="sequel_num", element="step", palette = ['#688311', '#251e83'])
sns.move_legend(p, "upper right", title='Movies', frameon=False)
plt.title("Similar Popularity Scores; Originals Have Slight Edge")
plt.ylabel("Movie Count")
plt.xlabel("Log of Popularity")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

#### Do Sequels Typically Recieve Less Budget?

:::{.callout-note}
These number *are* inflation adjusted using the CPI.
:::

```{python}
# | echo: false
sequels12 = data.query("sequel_num in [1,2,3,4]")
x = sequels12.groupby('sequel_num')['adjusted_budget'].agg("mean").index.to_list()
y = sequels12.groupby('sequel_num')['adjusted_budget'].agg("mean").to_list()
p = sns.barplot(x=x,y=y, color="#342bbb")
plt.title("On Average, Sequels Seem to Get More Budget")
p.text(x=-0.19, y=52_000_000, s="n=410", color = "white")
p.text(x=0.8, y=57_000_000, s="n=410", color = "white")
p.text(x=1.8, y=60_000_000, s="n=189", color = "white")
p.text(x=2.85, y=68_000_000, s="n=77", color = "white")
plt.ylabel("Budget $")
plt.xlabel("Sequel Number")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

**Takeaway:** Lower numbers of sequels are more common (you can see the N-size decrease as the sequel number increases), but the trend is clear; sequels on average recieve a higher budget.
