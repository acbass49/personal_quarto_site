### Introduction

I've wanted to do this post for a while now. When I was younger, it seemed movies were more of a one-off thing. Now, it feels like almost every movie has a sequel and sometimes many more. Lets look at some data to see what's going on here. For this analysis, I write down a series of questions and answer them one-by-one. Scroll down to see the questions ⬇️

### Data

For the data, I used [a list created on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003495084/) containing around 1200 movies and sequels. It is not an exhaustive list, but it covers a lot of ground. Unfortunately, this list was missing a few things I wanted such as the movie's revenue, budget, language, production company, and other variables. I joined these in via the [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). I am happy to share this data with others - just shoot me an email.

:::{.callout-warning}
The data from TMDB is community based - meaning people self-report the revenue and some of the other data. Unfortunately, this means that there may be errors at times in the data. There is state-of-the-art data and APIs available, but only through paywalls and I'm not paying 😂

### Questions

```{python}
# | include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#import my data
data = pd.read_csv("./cleaned_data.csv")
```

##### Are There More Sequels Over Time?

```{python}
# | echo: false
# filter to sequels only
sequels = data.query("sequel_num >= 2")

# Scatter plot X: Time, Y: Count
y = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].to_list()
x = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].index.to_list()

sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y)
plt.title("Sequels Spiked Around 2010")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Sequel Count")
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)
plt.show()
```

Add some commentary.

##### Do Sequels Make More Than The Original?

##### Are Sequels Rated Higher Than The Original?

##### Are Sequels More Popular Than The Original?

##### Do Sequels Typically Recieve Less Budget?

##### Does Budget Affect The Success of Sequels?

##### How Does Time Between a Film and Its Sequel Affect Its Success?

##### Are Sequels Who Keep The Same Director More Or Less Successful?
