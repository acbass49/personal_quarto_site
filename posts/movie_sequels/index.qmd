## Introduction

I've wanted to do this post for a while now. When I was younger, it seemed movies were more of a one-off thing. Now, it feels like almost every movie has a sequel and sometimes many more. Lets look at some data to see what's going on here. For this analysis, I write down a series of questions and answer them one-by-one. Scroll down to see the questions ⬇️

## Data

For the data, I used [a list created on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003495084/) containing around 1200 movies and sequels. It is not an exhaustive list, but it covers a lot of ground. Unfortunately, this list was missing a few things I wanted such as the movie's revenue, budget, language, production company, and other variables. I joined these in via the [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). I am happy to share this data with others - just shoot me an email.

:::{.callout-warning}
The data from TMDB is community based - meaning people self-report the revenue and some of the other data. Unfortunately, this means that there may be errors at times in the data. There is state-of-the-art data and APIs available, but only through paywalls and I'm not paying 😂

## Questions

```{python}
# | include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#import my data
data = pd.read_csv("./cleaned_data.csv")
```

#### Are There More Sequels Over Time?

```{python}
# | echo: false
# filter to sequels only
to_join = pd.read_csv("./to_join.csv")
sequels = data.query("sequel_num >= 2")

# Scatter plot X: Time, Y: Count
y = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].to_list()
x = sequels.groupby("Year").agg('count')['Title'].index.to_list()

#Joining in all movies
sequels = pd.DataFrame({"Num_sequels":y,"Year":x})
sequels = sequels.merge(to_join, on="Year", how="left")
y2 = sequels["Movie_num"]

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

color = 'tab:red'
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Sequel Count', color=color)
ax1.plot(x, y, color=color)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()  # instantiate a second axes that shares the same x-axis

color = 'tab:blue'
ax2.set_ylabel('Movie Count', color=color)  # we already handled the x-label with ax1
ax2.plot(x, y2, color=color)
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

fig.tight_layout()  # otherwise the right y-label is slightly clipped
plt.annotate(
    "Source: IMBD/TMBD",
    xy=(0.7, -0.17),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
)

plt.title("Sequels Spiked Around 2010")
plt.show()
```

Add some commentary.

#### Do Sequels Make More Than The Original?

#### Are Sequels Rated Higher Than The Original?

#### Are Sequels More Popular Than The Original?

#### Do Sequels Typically Recieve Less Budget?

#### Does Budget Affect The Success of Sequels?

#### How Does Time Between a Film and Its Sequel Affect Its Success?

#### Are Sequels Who Keep The Same Director More Or Less Successful?
