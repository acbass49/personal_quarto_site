# You're Doing Book Reviews Now?

I don't have research to show per say, but I seem to remember things better when I write them down. So, I want to start writing reviews of books I want to remember. Since this is mainly a data science blog, I will generally try and include data science related books, but I may share an unrelated book or two if I really like it.

As I go through this, I am not necessarily going to summarize the entire book, but will just highlight a few things I'm interested in and then give my final recommendation to other data science folks.

# Introduction

When looking up books on experimentation, [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Ron-Kohavi/dp/1108724264) stands out. It highly rated and published relatively recently. It claims that part of the reason big tech companies have been so successful is due to utilizing online controlled experiments - changing minor parts of a user's experience with the brand such as website layout, timing, ranking, and even colors. With these comparison methods, you can optimize your website adding on small improvements that compound into bigger results. The authors claim to have utilized these methods at Google, LinkedIn, and Microsoft.

In a particularly memorable example, they describe Google experimenting with 70-ish different shades of blue for link colors. There was a clear winner that measurably impacted revenue when the switch was made to the winner. The point I took away from this was with unprecedented amounts of data we can answer questions we've never been able to answer before. Also, things we always thought might have been trivial may not actually be - like the shade of blue on a link.

# Methods

One thing, I appreciated about this book is it gave an overview of several different methods. I could go through and skip the methods I was already familiar with. For example, I was familiar with Regression Discontinuity Design(RDD), but was not familiar with Interupted Time Series (ITS) and Interleaved Experiments for ranking algorithms. It also provides lots of links to papers for further reading throughout the book.
