## Intro

Google trends may even be able to do more than just [measure discrimination](./posts/google_trends/) and [reveal our secrets](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Lies-Internet-About-Really-ebook/dp/B01AFXZ2F4). What if it could predict US elections? It would be quite timely as we have another one in a few months.

While there aren't complicated models, I thought I would display the last 5 US elections for which we have google trends data (earliest trends data is in 2004).

I am planning on building an election model for this year, and will use my findings in this post!

## Chart Decisions

In every google trends search, there are a few essential decisions to make like search query string and filter parameters.

1. Search Query: For the charts below, I decided to use the last name of the candidate. This would be least likely to mispell and also a simpler search with fewer characters than putting the whole name. The last name search generally had a higher hit rate than the full name of the candidate.
2. I decided to use the time period from August 1 to November 7 on each election year. I selected this because there are mail in ballots that can be sent in weeks+ in advance. Plus, having the date range a few months out picks up media attention close to the election.

#### Bush Vs. Kerry

<script type="text/javascript">
trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Kerry","geo":"US","time":"2004-08-01 2004-11-07"},{"keyword":"Bush","geo":"US","time":"2004-08-01 2004-11-07"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2004-08-01%202004-11-07&geo=US&q=Kerry,Bush&hl=en","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});
</script>

For these charts, the part to pay most attention to is the bar chart on the left-hand side (only viewable using desktop). This is going to show the average over the time period observed. We see for our first chart Bush was searched more consistently across the board throughout the time period though Kerry was often close behind in hits.

Bush won this election and had a higher average hit rate: 1/1
