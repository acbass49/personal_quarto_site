Hi! My name is Alex Bass. I work as a data scientist at [Dynata](https://www.dynata.com/), a leading polling and market research firm. Also, I am a graduate student at the [University of Virginia in Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/).

Recently, I find myself doing data analysis and programming projects in my free time. I created this blog as a place to post some of these fun projects I work on off the clock. [Check it out!](blog.qmd)
