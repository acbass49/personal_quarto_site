Hi! My name is Alex Bass (add email). I work as a data science contractor at [Meta](https://about.meta.com) analyzing their marketing data. I am also the creator and maintainer of the open-source [python package `survey_tools`](https://github.com/acbass49/survey_tools).

After [grad school](https://datascience.virginia.edu/), I found a lot more free time for personal projects. So, I created this website for a place to share [projects](projects.qmd) and occasionally [write about data](blog.qmd).

Would love to connect if you have any thoughts or comments on my work. Contact me via any of the links ðŸ™‚
