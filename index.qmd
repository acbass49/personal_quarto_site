Hi! My name is Alex Bass. 

I am a data scientist who specializes in surveys, experiments, and causal inference. Previously, I have worked at two political polling firms, a survey internet panel provider, and most recently Meta.

I created this website to share [projects](projects.qmd) and to write up [random thoughts and analyses](blog.qmd). I publish my more recent work on Substack focusing on [social science study of Mormons and Latter-day Saints](https://mormonmetrics.substack.com).

Please contact me at [alex@mtnmetricslab.com](mailto:alex@mtnmetricslab.com). Would love to connect about anything data, potential collaborations, or just to shoot the breeze 🍃
