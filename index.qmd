Hi! My name is Alex Bass. I work as a data science contractor at [Meta](https://about.meta.com) analyzing their marketing data. I also run the Mormon Metrics [blog](https://mormonmetrics.com) and [Twitter/X account](https://twitter.com/mormon_metrics) where I post weekly data charts about Mormons and Religion.

After [grad school](https://datascience.virginia.edu/), I found a lot more free time for personal projects. So, I created this website for a place to [write about data](blog.qmd) and share [projects](projects.qmd) I work on off the clock.

Would love to connect if you have any thoughts or comments on my work. Contact me via any of the links ðŸ™‚
