Hi! My name is Alex Bass. 

I am a data scientist who specializes in surveys, experiments, and causal inference. Previously, I have worked at two political polling firms, a survey internet panel provider, and most recently Meta.

I created this website to share [projects](projects.qmd) and to write up [random thoughts and analyses](blog.qmd).

Please contact me at [hello@alexbass.me](mailto:hello@alexbass.me). Would love to connect about anything data, potential collaborations, or just to shoot the breeze üçÉ
