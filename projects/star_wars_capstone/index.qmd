## Introduction

In 2020, I completed a capstone project for my undergraduate degree in Political Science at BYU. I recieved funding from the Political Science department to field a survey from an online panel (n=1000), [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/). I was interested in studying..

1. the effect of whether detecting political messages in a film had on the likeability of that film.
2. whether parties were sensitive to out-party messages. For example, Republicans would more readily recognize Democratic messaging and vice versa.

## What I Asked in the Survey..

To find the answer to these questions, I picked a popular movie that had been in theatres recently, Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker. Then, I asked questions about whether they saw it, and if so, did they detected any political messages and like the film.

## What I Found...

Of the 1000 I surveyed, 361 had seen the movie. Here are some stats about them...

The individuals who watched Star Wars skewed male, older, and higher income. Given a simple t-test, there was no significant difference in party affiliation, voting in the last election, and education. Of the 361 watching *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*
80 identified a political message.

From this point, I wanted to evaluate whether political message detection led to a decrease in likeability of the film. So, I fit a linear regression model using several demographic variables with the variable of interest using a 10 point scale of likeability as the dependent variable. From this model, I found that it had an effect at the 90% confidence level. The interpretation being... **if a political message was detected by the respondent, my model predicts that person rates it 0.5 points lower on the likeability scale.**

The second part is digging further into the types of messages that were detected and by what party...

From this figure, we see that Republicans were less likely to detect a poltical message than Independents and Democrats. Also, it seems like everyone seemed to detect more democratic messages than republican messages; however, I really need a larger sample to tell because only 7 republicans detected a message.

Perhaps unneccessary, but to get actual estimated probabilities of each person being in this group, I fit a multinomial logistic regression on the dependent variable of the type of political message the respondent detected: Republican, Democrat, or unclear.

No, this graph wasn't made in R. This model was estimated and the figure was made in Stata for those social science folks who can tell by its distinct style ðŸ˜‚
:::

As you can see from across the board, people more often detect democrat political messages, but it doesn't seem to differ by party. Although, especially for Republicans, the confidence intervals are pretty wide for these estimates.

## Reflections From a Few Years Down the Road...

I worked really hard on this project and am honestly proud of the work I did. However, that doesn't mean that If I were to do it now, I wouldn't change things. Here's what I would change:

1. As much as I love Star Wars, it would be more interesting if the project was generalizable to movies in aggregate. I could have asked about the most recent movie the respondent has seen. I would have gotten more respondents watching movies and been able to make better estimates. It would have also been interesting to dive into what genres of which people are more willing to hear political messages. The tradeoff would be, though, I wouldn't know some fun stats about the demographics of *Star Wars* movie watchers ðŸ˜‚
2. I would be interested in experiementing with **weighting** in the models and in my stats I reported. This was hardly a representative sample with so many democrats which is typical of online panels. It would have been helpful for me to set **quotas** when fielding to help make it more of a representative sample. These are things I wasn't thinking about at the time, but now dealing with surveys for the past bit at my work, this is where my mind goes.

What do you think? Hopefully, you learned something about Star Wars and politics you didn't know before.
